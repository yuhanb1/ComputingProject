He'll a teacher and mentor to our students and staff at Dookie as they conduct research and engage with local industry:  @DrAnneline @unimelbbrewing! Soil salinity affects ⅓ of cropland, stunts plant growth and leaves a crust of salt on the surface, earning it the nickname "white cancer". But some plants tolerate salinity – their secret may be how silicon affects movement of sodium through the plant: 
 We're all becoming more aware of our carbon footprint, but research like this is helping us to understand the nitrogen footprint of the food we eat and energy we use. Our experts explain what you need to know here:  @AusHCIndia @unimelb @ausind_edu @GlennFBrowning @4DVirtualFarm Good suggestion - #BloodOration it is.

@unimelb @TimDoddEDU @pennydee @ScholarsLeague Well done to our Honorary Senior Fellow, Dr Lee Berger, winning the 2018 Frank Fenner Prize for Life Scientist of the Year #PMPrize @ScienceGovAu @uommedia Dr Berger's amazing work includes saving frogs from extinction:  @ShaunCoffey @SalFisher19 @CrawfordFund @roseycatherine @ACIARAustralia @ACIARCEO @farmingforever We've actually got a public lecture by Dark Emu author Bruce Pascoe on 13 November, if you're in Melbourne that evening:  Despite appearing in accounts of early European explorers, complex Indigenous agricultural systems were omitted from Australia's history until recently – but they may have lessons for our future. In this lecture, Dark Emu author Bruce Pascoe explores our precolonial agriculture. What’s the future of agriculture, food and veterinary research? Join the discussion with our Head of Ag and Food Herbert Kronzucker, veterinary research director @JoanneDevlin15, crop protection leader Rohan Rainbow and senior public servant Cassandra Meagher on 12 November. The Wildlife Disease Association’s Australasian section has awarded Dr Pam Whiteley, the inaugural veterinarian at #HealesvilleSanctuary, the prestigious Spratty award in recognition of her service and commitment to wildlife health. Congratulations Pam!  Final year Agriculture students work in teams spanning animal science, crop and soil science and ag economics to identify practical responses to real issues facing agriculture and present these to industry. Find out whose solutions took home a prize here:  @Ashe303 @china_geography @marcialangton Hi Ashe, the lecture is now online:  "...when the first so-called 'explorers' entered many parts of the country, they observed and recorded Aboriginal people engaged in agricultural practice... And yet our history books refer to none of it." You can now listen to our public lecture by Bruce Pascoe online. Congratulations to all Australian and @UniMelb #HighlyCitedResearchers, but especially our own professors, soil ecologist Jim He and geneticist Michael Goddard! Researchers are selected for production of multiple  papers that rank in the top 1% by citations for field and year.  Farmers close to capitals provide much of their food, but are caught in a cost price squeeze between high land prices and low farm-gate prices. @DrRachelCarey and @JenSheridan consulted with farmers to find solutions – what else could help?  @CassandraDavitt Excellent work, and welcome to Twitter! Did you miss lectures on indigenous foods and university-industry-government collaboration at our Research Week 2018 series of events? Catch up on these and prizewinning posters and presentations on using native Australian grains in baking and securing peri-urban farmland below. 47 high school students learned about the science of agriculture over three days of activities led by university mentors at our Dookie campus during the ConocoPhillips Science Experience. Great to host these future scientists and show them where agriculture can take them!  Congratulations to FVAS academic and food and wine scientist Dr Pangzhen Zhang, who has been appointed to the board of @veskiorg! Pange was a veski sustainable agriculture fellow in 2015 and now represents veski alumni on the board:  A study by our researchers confirms a rise in megaesophagus cases in dogs was linked to pet food:  @CrawfordFund Thanks, we'll spread the word next week! @KidmanReid Hi George, looks like you've been having a great time since you finished uni!

Reading in the comfy lounge area sitting by the windows has proven to be a favourite so far! @unimelb @MelbVetSchool @unimelb @bec_doyle In 1943, agricultural colleges didn't admit women, but a farm training year in the @unimelb Agricultural Science degree provided agricultural scientist Nancy Millis with an experience that influenced the rest of her brilliant career.

#UnimelbPursuit #IWD2019 #BalanceForBetter This week we welcome four visiting academics from @UoMSciEng to develop connections for future collaboration and funding application for the development of cost-effective sensor systems and networks for scalable precision agriculture programs. #precisionag Congratulations to sustainable agriculture researcher Xia (Emma) Liang for receiving a prestigious award! Her PhD initiated a new field of research: measuring the #nitrogen footprint of agricultural production systems to combat climate change. @golfdeli @unimelb Senior Lecturer Stuart Barber (@4DVirtualFarm) on the sheep of 2039: they will need to be resilient, easy to care for – and well-managed: "We have to make sure we have the licence from the 95 per cent of people that don't live on farms and don't know a lot about farms." To ensure a resilient and sustainable foodbowl, farmland should be permanently protected on Melbourne’s fringe by maintaining the Urban Growth Boundary, mapping agricultural land and introducing a new food production zone, a new Foodprint report has found:  By identifying changes in stride characteristics of racehorses over time we can identify those parameters that can be used as an early indicator of injury or that are key to injury development – thanks to @Grayson_JC for funding this research for equine safety!  With at least 501 amphibian species declined and 90 extinct, this parasite is "among the most destructive invasive species we have ever seen". New research by ANU's @BenCScheele and our @OneHealthRes shows urgent need for better #wildlife #biosecurity.

#OneHealth #UnimelbPursuit While #Budget2019's $10b disaster emergency fund and investment in rural infrastructure, R&amp;D and land restoration are welcome, more detail is needed for agriculture on the climate investment statement and support for ag innovation, says Prof Ruth Nettle.

Tweet along on #wildlife21. Ted Leighton: we have changed the ecology, and the dynamics and risks of disease #wildlife21 TL: hosts, pathogens and environments lead to disease. Until recently we only paid attention to the first two #wildlife21 TL: what caused the same Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1998? More intense farming - a change in environment #wildlife21 TL: the rate of disease emergence - particularly ones that originate in animals - has increased greatly in the last 6 decades. #wildlife21 TL: wild animal populations are victims of disease, but also lose humanity as an ally when they become reservoirs of disease #wildlife21 TL: states only know through surveillance what pathogens exist in wildlife in their borders. Only after this can they respond #wildlife21 TL: most people shy away from seeing the exponential growth of human population as a problem... But it's not sustainable #wildlife21 TL: so far the best way to monitor wild animal disease is to have networks of interested people who report deaths and signals #wildlife21 Thank you for joining us for Wildlife Health in the 21st Century.

Tonight Tina Widowski - Animal Welfare expert is our guest speaker on #henwelfare She is here to share the story of how the laying hens life is changing in the US #henwelfare Canada will phase out battery cages by 2036 #henwelfare How did we end up with battery cages in the first place? Efficiency and disease management #henwelfare How do we measure the effect of production on animals? Animal welfare science #henwelfare But quality of life can be objectively defines in a number of ways #henwelfare But physical wellness does not necessarily equate psychological wellness #henwelfare While negative states have been investigated over the last few decades, more recently positive states have been a focus #henwelfare A third perspective on animal welfare is one of natural living - which is more of an ethical approach than purely scientific. #henwelfare So what do hens want? There are 4 major behavior patterns that tell us - we measure this with preference and motivation test #henwelfare The first thing is: a nest. Most hens prefer to lay in a nest box #henwelfare Two: a perch. Hens like to perch up high as a way to get away from predators. #henwelfare Third: hens need foraging material. Even if supplied readily they like to work for their food by foraging #henwelfare Fourthly - hens like to dust bathe every 2-3 days. #henwelfare How do hens fare in different housing systems in relation to this behaviors? #henwelfare People don't think of large inside systems where hens move freely when they think of cage free #henwelfare Non-cage and free range provide more space and opportunities to engage in healthy behavior #henwelfare But this comes with increased risk of disease and cannibalism. But it also comes down to good management of these systems #henwelfare Scroll down to find our live stream of #henwelfare talk with Tina Widowski. Are furnished cages and colonies a good compromise for #henwelfare? What are the environmental impacts of different systems? Food safety, worker safety and affordability are also considerations in choosing housing systems #henwelfare Do hens want to range? As a hen welfare expert this is a question we seriously need to ask #henwelfare Defining what free range means should stem from what hens want - this should lead decisions about housing and stocking density #henwelfare What can science do? We can provide objective evidence on criteria for good animal welfare to improve animal welfare #henwelfare Science cannot identify practices that will satisfy all stakeholders #henwelfare  but it should inform decisions #henwelfare Watch on #Periscope: Marketing vs Science - Who is winning the free range egg debate with Professor Tina Widowski @…  U-Vet equine vets help baby elephant stand.
