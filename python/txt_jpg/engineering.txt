Tune in from 5:12pm AEDT to see @cis_unimelb's @SueletteD join @ABCthedrum's panel this evening.  From 'catastrophic' bushfires in Queensland to wild downpours in Sydney, this week has been one of weather-related extremes for Australia - so how do we create models to ensure we're adequately prepared for these increasingly common phenomena?  An independent review into the New South Wales government‚Äôs iVote system has found that while security of the online voting platform is enough to get it over the line, more could be done to lift defences.  What's ahead for engineering? In the wake of the release of the Victorian State of Engineering Report, Enterprise Professor @GFoliente shares some of his thoughts.  We're working on ways to keep driverless traffic flowing and safe, by simulating the behaviour and unwritten rules pedestrians and drivers use to negotiate traffic.  Without a coherent national approach to our electricity market, Australia risks reduced reliability, higher prices and missed targets, argues Professor Michael Brear.  .@mediatecture's #BiometricMirror was definitely the coolest 2018 tech to make this top 10 list, but maybe a bit more "insight into a possible dystopian future if we don't ask serious questions about #AI" than "wacky".  Congrats to two of our Biodesign Innovation subject teams on their success in @MTGT_Challenge - Ventora was 1 of 5 groups to get $10,000 in funding while Horizen took the $1,000 People's Choice.

National Science Challenge for girls and parents, run by the fantastic folks at @robogals.  Deadline - 30 Sept. http://bit.ly/qK59xb¬† A collection of @unimelb experts spoke to @openforum_au about the research that got their attention in 2018 -  What a year 2018 was, bursting with exciting new discoveries and ideas - here are 12 of our favourites.  Can we really put our trust in #AI? With this technology getting more and more prevalent, @REA_Group's @nxdnz looked at what's ahead in a world where artificial intelligence touches on so many aspects of daily life.  You may not immediately see the connection between earthquakes, financial market crashes, wars and epileptic seizures, but a fundamental mathematical principle may connect them all and be the answer to reliably predicting epileptic seizures.  Impacting anywhere from one in seven to one in four Australians at any given time, low back pain can have a massive impact on quality of life. Now new research is offering hope to sufferers of this common ailment through crowdsourced support.   Could the falling cost of #renewables be the game changer that makes hydrogen fuel economic?  The @MAPUniMelb alumni behind the innovative Nuraphone headphones have the tech community very interested in their latest development.  Bluetooth technology has helped reveal how visitors explore museum exhibitions, and how much they learn in the process.  What's behind Australia's love affair with virtual home apps? Dr Eduardo Velloso explained to @Domaincomau.   An apartment fire, this time in Melbourne, has reignited discussion about the risks of cheap flammable building cladding. But is there an affordable and safe alternative? Research by Kate Nguyen may have unlocked the answer.   From bushfires to floods, Australia's no stranger to weather-related disasters, and evidence points to this becoming the new norm - so how do we make sure we're prepared?  @unimelb @unilibrary We were doing geek chic AND computing before they were cool. Is it really a myth that our data isn‚Äôt safe as recently claimed by the Director-General Australian Signals Directorate? @VTeagueAus delved into the issue to do a bit of myth-busting.  ‚ÄúWhen I was growing up, there weren‚Äôt any female role models that were engineers in the media." 

Professor Elaine Wong explains how growing representation in pop culture helps encourage women to get involved in STEM. #WomeninSTEM #WomeninScience4SDGs  After losing a friend in a car accident caused by a driver using a mobile phone, MSE alumnus Alex Jannink's developed a world-first mobile phone detection camera - now it's part of a NSW Government trial and is already highlighting how big the problem is.  Human error plays an incredibly significant role in traffic casualties. Enterprise Professor Peter Sweatman's looking at how engineering can tackle this important issue.  Speaking at the recent Cyber Storm international conference, Dr Atif Ahmad discussed the strong internal capabilities of Australia's big four banks in responding to cyberattacks, but noted that there is still work to be done on attribution.  If you couldn't keep up with all the incredible #STEM stories last month, we don't blame you - it was an innovation-packed start to the year. Here are 10 of our top highlights.  What are the unique challenges and opportunities for hardware startups in today‚Äôs eco-system? @MAPUniMelb are hosting a panel of experts including engineers, industrial designers and founders in Melbourne next week to discuss.  New #AI technology is predicting when you reach for your smartphone and making the most of your handset's battery life.   Best of luck to the six students from @UniMelbMDHS and MSE selected to represent @unimelb at the 2019 Emory Global Health Case Competition in Atlanta!

#watersecurity19 The panel is joined on stage by @ROB_VERTESSY #watersecurity19  First question to Mike Stewardson: some critics argue last decade of money and effort invested in environmental water purchases and water saving infrastructure in the Basin isn't showing benefit; how do you see things? #watersecurity19 First question for Nick Bond: recent years have seen a number of ecological shocks in the Basin, with some arguing there are symptoms of collapse; are we facing some kind of endgame in the Basin? #watersecurity19 Bond: worth reflecting on ecological shocks as major drivers of policy reform in the Basin. #watersecurity19 Bond: recent Darling fish deaths have shone a lot of public attention on the health of the system and how we're tracking. #watersecurity19 Bond: the elephant in the room is climate change; unprecedented drought, record heatwaves #watersecurity19 Bond: the Basin systems are resilient and have adapted remarkably, but this resilience has its limits - it's safe to say there are parts of the Basin that will see irreversible change. #watersecurity19 First question for Sue Jackson: the Basin Plan aims for appropriate balance between social, economic &amp; environmental needs for water across the region; given people feel very differently about these things, is this an impossible goal? #watersecurity19 Jackson: integrating these three pillars is a huge challenge in the MDB #watersecurity19 Jackson: if we look at framing provided in Basin Plan, it provides guidance on priorities and constraints. #watersecurity19 Jackson talks about the importance of optimising for efficiency, not so much balance, but we are faced with a variety of contentious questions about how we optimise. #watersecurity19 First question for @rene_woods: there are now many voices calling for the stronger involvement of Aboriginal people in water management; where are we getting it right and how do we accelerate progress? #watersecurity19 Woods: Aboriginal people weren't involved in the early stages - now they have the opportunity to participate and provide Indigenous perspectives on the Basin. #watersecurity19 Woods: Aboriginal people want to be involved, the state governments haven't offered a seat the table previously, but are now putting forward funding to involve traditional owners. #watersecurity19 Woods: where we can do better is communication from states, Federal Government, and MDBA. #watersecurity19 First question for Lee Godden: are the Murray-Darling's problems largely due to imposing a system of cooperative federalism that frustrates ability to resolve water security conflicts between upstream &amp; downstream states? #watersecurity19 Godden: we have had a history since before federation of very different interests between states. #watersecurity19 Godden: water policy is also cultural policy, social policy. #watersecurity19 Godden: the cooperative model in the MDB really needs to be reinvigorated with a clear sense of purpose. #watersecurity19 Question for Godden: water markets were introduced to increase economic efficiency of water allocation and have enhanced water security for irrigators; do you think water markets have helped or harmed water security for the environment? #watersecurity19 Godden: there are issues around speculation, tightness of market governance is able to deal well with it. #watersecurity19 Godden: what we're not dealing well with are the indirect effects. #watersecurity19 Question for @rene_woods: what are cultural flows and how do they benefit Aboriginal people? How should we change Basin water allocations to deliver them? #watersecurity19 Woods: having a say on where water goes in your country is so powerful. #watersecurity19 @claireo_booth Hi Claire - it was recorded, keep an eye out for it being posted next week (along with answers to the questions I missed while I was frantically live-tweeting) ^Carl A new report for the government that investigates the causes of the recent mass fish deaths in the lower Darling River finds climate change and water access agreements helped create a deadly mix. #murraydarling #watersecurity19  Professor Amanda Ellis is welcoming attendees to today‚Äôs Future of Crop Waste Forum - follow along and join in using #cropwaste19  Professor Frank Vetere discusses @unimelb's collaborative relationships with industry and government to advance crop waste research - discover more about these at  Up now is Barry McGraw, Director of Product Development and Commercialization at Ohio Soybean Council. #cropwaste19 McGraw: soybeans currently used for human food, animal feed and bioproducts. 

Soybeans generate $2.5 billion in annual revenue in Ohio and create about 30,000 jobs.

#cropwaste19 McGraw talking about different uses for soybean byproducts - applications in everything from roofing to farming and even creating vodka. #cropwaste19 Will Taing and @CalFoulner from @beanstalkagtech are now up chatting challenge-led innovation for solving crop waste. 
#cropwaste19 .@CalFoulner: Of the 3.6 billion tonnes of food produced annually, 1.3 billion tonnes gets wasted.  #cropwaste19 Challenge led innovation - Will Taing from @beanstalkagtech says often better known as open innovation, and is a concept that has been around for a while. #cropwaste19 Up now, Byron de Kock, R&amp;D Manager for @Hort_Au. #cropwaste19 de Kock: the large volume of wasted food presents a massive opportunity, opportunities like biogas and extruded materials to add value (broccoli latte anyone?). #cropwaste19 Now up, Allan Williams, Acting General Management, R&amp;D Investment, Cotton Research and Development Corporation. #cropwaste19 Williams: 1 tonne of cotton seed produces 100kg of 'trash'. #cropwaste19 Next up, Sam Oakden, Manager of Food Sustainability at Food innovation Australia Limited (FIAL) #cropwaste19 Ng Pei Kang, CEO of TRIA, talking about a zero waste solution so single use food packaging. #cropwaste19 Ng: recent reports have found that microplastics are found in 90% of table salt. #cropwaste19 Ng: biodegradable plastics take too long and too many resources to biodegrade. #cropwaste19 Ng: Bio24 Digestion technology allows for processing of food packaging and food waste in 24 hours to produce compost. #cropwaste19 Now speaking: @middis, Chief Innovation Officer at @tamu_group, talking about their creation of a new food grade fibre. #cropwaste19 .@middis: growth in sales of dietary fibre have been in double digit growth, but how do you sell fibre to people in an attractive way, 

Well, gut beats anus. 

Focus on gut bacteria, not toilet habits. #cropwaste19 Now hearing from Christos Karantonis, Managing Director and Founder, @PyrotechEnergy #cropwaste19 Karantonis explains pyrolysis - a thermal cracking of molecules in the absence of oxygen - which leads to creation of char, gases and liquids. #cropwaste19 We're back from lunch with Professor James Clark from the Green Chemistry Centre of Excellence, University of York, speaking about biomass as a feedstock for green and sustainable chemicals. #cropwaste19 Now up is our own Professor Amanda Ellis talking about the work @unimelb is doing around crop waste research. #cropwaste19 Ellis: some of the collaborations we've worked on with industry &amp; govt. -  biobased foams, cereal and grain crops, building and construction materials and more #cropwaste19 Ellis discusses the growth in domestic Australian consumption of soybeans, and the gap in the market left by this for making the most of soybean hull waste. #cropwaste19 Ellis: another big project is looking at using biochar for soil remediation. #cropwaste19 Associate Professor Kathryn Mumford from our School is now up to talk about her research in solvent extraction. #cropwaste19 Final presentation before we move into our ideation and hackathon session - @FVASunimelb's Dr Graham Brodie on microwave pyrolysis of biowaste. #cropwaste19 We‚Äôre proud to be partnered with @BoeingAustralia in 2019 as part of a united effort to strengthen the STEM talent pipeline.

Computer Science the "coding of ideas". #uomit There are significant skills shortages in the IT industry. IT is a pathway to a vast array of career areas. #uomit Why Melbourne? We're ranked #1 in Australia for IT. We attract great students who help us to do great things. #uomit The Melbourne Model allows you to gain deep IT skills and combine them with the discipline of your choice such as business or science #uomit Over the course of your study you will build a rich tool box to solve problems. #uomit Our students have created their own succesful start ups with funding support from the Melbourne Accelerator Program @MAPUniMelb. #uomit Our majors: Computing and Software Systems - for students interested in programming and system building. #uomit Informatics major - for students interested in what can be done with data. #uomit Geomatics major.
