I'd died and gone to heaven. @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J: Law schools should be concerned with passing on a capacity to deal with knowledge &amp; application of legal principle @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J: When I went to the Bar the staple diet was the crash &amp; bash jurisdiction of Mag Cts @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J on working with Dawson – he would write out arguments word for word – but always delivered with seamless aplomb. @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J on working as an advocate - the lectern at the High Court 'the loneliest place on Earth'. @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J - working as a judge at first instance - an uncomfortable idea, but takes 4 or 5 years to learn to be a judge @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J - one of the joys of being a trial judge is the endless parade of witnesses; a rare and remarkable experience @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J – judicial inspiration — when losing litigant left court absolutely satisfied because judge heard what he had to say @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J on appointment to the HCA: no pre-warning, Attorney called @4:30pm, confirmed @5pm &amp; public 20 minutes later @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J on working with associates: still in touch with all of 36, a relationship to continue for their whole careers @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J - keeping on top of the sheer volume of work - never underestimate the quality of oral argument, always A to A+ @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J - relationship between academy &amp; the bench - thoughtful commentary invaluable, but must articulate *why* Court wrong @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J - on upcoming masterclass @MelbLawSchool - there are insights to be gathered, outside your specialisation. HAYNE J Q&amp;A — 
Q: Reflections on SCOTUS?
A: Not close enough to SCOTUS to opine if "politicians in robes". @MelbLawSchool (Cont) 
HAYNE J: Query if court system has "priced itself out of the market"; troubling if people not resorting to courts @MelbLawSchool (Cont)
Q: Favourite founding father?
Hayne J: Constitution 'a remarkable tribute to a remarkable drafter'. @MelbLawSchool Q: Co-authorship with Gummow J philosophical or coincidental?
HAYNE J: We didn't do it hand in hand. @MelbLawSchool (cont)
HAYNE J: Almost all works began as the work of a single Justice. Co-authorship must be understood in that context. @MelbLawSchool (cont) 
HAYNE J: important sometimes that court speaks with one voice, esp in criminal law cases. @MelbLawSchool (cont) 
HAYNE J: Often of like mind with Gummow J, sought to get to the answer while arguments still fresh in mind. @MelbLawSchool HAYNE J - lost opportunities to settle the law: better to leave smaller footprint; don't know enough to leave a larger one @MelbLawSchool Last question: Time on HCA — any regrets?
Hayne J: If you can't find the fun in it, give it up. I found the fun in it. @MelbLawSchool That concludes Hayne J in conversation with Dean Evans @MelbLawSchool for @CCCSMelbourne conference.

Hayne J @CCCSMelbourne: "is it not time for a more sophisticated framework for thinking about executive power?" Follow @CCCSMelbourne Con Law Conference. Join in the conversation #cccscon15 @rosalinddixon15: proportionality an invaluable tool for structuring judicial judgment; provides transparency of reasoning #CCCSCon15 @rosalinddixon15: the better view is that SCOTUS does use proportionality reasoning, but in the form of levels of scrutiny #CCCSCon15 @rosalinddixon15: cf proportionality discourse endorsed by HCA; but 'reasonably appropriate &amp; adapted' the preferred formula #CCCSCon15 @rosalinddixon15: "can we use proportionality in Australia without judges exercising quasi-political judgment?" #CCCSCon15 @rosalinddixon15: #auscon would be richer if we use proportionality discourse; but foreign approaches must be adapted #CCCSCon15 @rosalinddixon15: proportionality makes quasi-political judgment inevitable, but must be avoided by courts where possible #CCCSCon15 @blberger up next discussing proportionality in Canada #CCCSCon15 @blberger: "proportionality has long served as a measure of state actions when liberties &amp; interests are concerned" #CCCSCon15 @blberger speaking on the metastasization of proportionality in Canadian constitutional law #CCCSCon15 http://t.co/VU5tJprur5 @blberger: spread of proportionality into admin law — reasonableness = proportionality where Charter right at stake #CCCSCon15 @blberger: proportionality in Canada allows courts to take government objectives seriously #CCCSCon15 @blberger: expansion of proportionality problematic — has shortcomings; should not allow it to occupy the entire field #CCCSCon15 Now Nye Perram J: proportionality a judicial technique which emerges outside text of Constitution #CCCSCon15 @NyePerram: may not be enough biological life in the #auscon rights environment to import foreign concepts of proportionality #CCCSCon15 Kris Walker SC: re proportionality analysis, perhaps #auscon behind the rest of the world? #CCCSCon15 @s_m_stephenson: will proportionality in #auscon open up the pandora box of values? #CCCSCon15 @rosalinddixon15: proportionality tells us how to structure a judgment, it doesn't tell us the answer @CCCSCon15 That concludes the discussion of #conlaw in comparative perspective: proportionality in constitutional law #CCCCon15 Now — the Contribution of Hayne J to Australian Public Law #CCCSCon15 NETTLE J: Cases among the finest of Hayne J's contributions: X7 and Lee #CCCSCon15 Stephen Donaghue QC: discussing Hayne J's contributions jurisdictional error as a limit on cth &amp; state power #CCCSCon15 Stephen Donaghue: on how to spot a judgment authored by Hayne J #WilliamWade #LQR #CCCSCon15 Kris Walker: a delight to make a tribute to Hayne J before past &amp; present judges —particularly since they can't interrupt me! #CCCSCon15 Kris Walker: Hayne J was almost always in the majority in political communication cases — indicative of his influence #CCCSCon15 Kris Walker: Hayne J's protective attitude to the implied freedom recognised the need for robust debate in Australian society #CCCSCon15 Frances Gordon: a common thread in Hayne J's dissents is a concern with 'unbounded power' #CCCSCon15 Frances Gordon: Hayne J's judicial method — reasons must be able to be assessed by a standard external to the judge #CCCSCon15 Nettle J on #federalism, Hayne J jumped in the centralist direction; Workchoices an example of this #CCCCon15 Richard Niall: is there any perception of an evolution of the judge, or consistency? #CCCSCon15 Hayne J: "I cannot tell you what tonight meant to me.

But AI raises regulatory &amp; ethical issues #lawtechreg @julianinoz: Regulation currently defines who can(not) give legal advice. In relation to AI, the question is: where is the line between advice and information? And is this distinction justifiable? #lawtechreg @julianinoz: What challenges do ALATs create as to the quality of legal advice? (1) Tech may carry out routine tasks better than humans (2) Who determines and who assures accuracy? (3) Quality vs access: when is 'good enough' good enough? @MelbNSI #lawtechreg @julianinoz: Technology also raises questions about competence. What do lawyers need to know about technology to be competent? When might failure to use technology be/become 'incompetent'? @MelbNSI #lawtechreg @julianinoz asks: How might Automated Legal Advice Technologies (ALATs) transform regulatory risk? Factors in risk assessment of ALATs include:
- accuracy of system coding/learning
- level of transparency
- risk of negative outcomes
- consequences of negative outcomes
#lawtechreg Response to the RALAT paper from Victoria Legal Aid's Katie Miller (@Natural_Justice). Katie was the author of the LIV report "Disruption, Innovation and Change: The Future of the Legal Profession" (December 2015). #lawtechreg @MelbNSI  @Natural_Justice: Regulating automated legal advice technologies is a longstanding quandary that the legal profession has been grappling with for a long time. A big part of that is the definition of "legal advice" -- time for revision? #lawtechreg @Natural_Justice: A big question for regulating automated legal advice technologies is how much law legal technologists need to know. @MelbNSI #lawtechreg @winkiepp @taxinator @Natural_Justice We didn't get to that last night, but it will be interesting to see if any consensus emerges from phase 2 of the project, when we really start talking to people! @winkiepp @taxinator @Natural_Justice @julianinoz @MelbNSI Perhaps this is where regulation can act as the disruptor, but probably need market-based, not profession-centric regulation The RALAT project conversation has been continuing today :) #lawtechreg  Note promise for a more generic platform from Eigen in the midst of this piece: Linklaters legal AI partner ropes in market-leading £13m investment  Excellent summary from @kate_fazio of a really useful paper on assisted digital services for law. Note too a crucial distinction: not assisted digital legal services...  Good to see these concerns being raised internationally - similar concerns being raised here by the ongoing @MelbNSI @lprn_mls RALAT project  @AmySalyzyn Agreed! Also how much is 'practice-readiness' really about shifting the cost of training from firms to trainees/universities? Fascinating case on privilege taking shape in England...

Smith’s perspective is as a feminist criminal defence lawyer. Headline is that there is a way to discharge her duties, and “sleep at night”. #ILEC18  “It goes without saying that sexism is part of defending an accused in date-rape cases” - Abbe Smith is candid in her assessment of being a criminal defence lawyer in sexual assault/rape cases #ILEC18 Elizabeth McDonald presents her paper ‘Controlling reliance on rape mythology in closing arguments by reference to ethical restraints: the current judicial role in Aotearoa New Zealand.’ #ILEC18  Jennifer Koshan presents her paper, ‘Judicial ethics and sexual assault’ #ILEC8  @greenbus You got me Helen!

Surprising there has not been more discussion of this  Should be a lively conversation on the Banking RC's impact on the role of in-house counsel and compliance teams: Thursday 7/3, @thelawcouncil 'Super2019' conference, with @BatrouneyQC, Katie Simpson, Energy Super, Jo Dwyer, @Corrslawyers, and @julianinoz from @lprn_mls  The delights of university life....  Sloppy analysis from LW - should have at least looked at the Aus and intnl research on disproportionality of misconduct findings - shows complex range of factors - misconduct by smaller firms often more obvious; small firm clients much more likely to go to regulator 1/2  2/2 small firms also more likely to be involved in areas of work that generate grievances against lawyers (fairly or otherwise), and more likely to be caught for trust account breaches (low hanging fruit for regulators)  Article does contain some worthwhile advice, however. Stresses of small firm practice definitely an important factor!  Maybe, but does this make important (and questionable?) assumptions about price transparency across legal services?  Charging $19k for photocopying a file (about 20 cents a page) - in the digital age? Oh dear!  Ouch!

Smith it is an archaeological dig. Most clients deny the offence, no detail too small Smith: "defence lawyers don't get to apologise.... Victims get to hate us, it is the least we can do for them" Smith: the ability to persuade often depends on the ability to play off biases or predictable stereotypes. Smith: my aim is to challenge not upset, I get in and get out, I don't want this witness on the stand for hours Smith: but my task is still to impugn the victim's character Smith: Why do it? I represent the poor, the cases are challenging, technically; they are triable. Accused are often interesting, flawed. Smith:  need to find a way to walk away with some peace.

November 1217: the first time the #MagnaCarta was paired with the Charter of the Forest to take shape as the great document we know today. Prof Paul Brand: "There were possibly more than 13 copies of the original 1215 #MagnaCarta in existence" Prof Brand: "There is only one single surviving copy of the November 1216 reissue of #MagnaCarta and it is housed in the Durham Cathedral" Prof Paul Brand (Miegunyah Lecture, 2015): There are four copies of the 1217 #MagnaCarta - the one we know today. Three are at @UniofOxford #MagnaCarta has a fascinating history! Prof Brand revealing the documents purpose, reissues, meanings &amp; publication. http://t.co/KPbp04DQd8 Prof Brand - "Regular publication and reading (4 times a year) of March 1300 reissue of #MagnaCarta became responsibility of local sheriffs" Prof Paul Brand - In mid 13th century #MagnaCarta begins to be distributed in legal  books. The beginnings of something great! Prof Paul Brand - There are many translations of the #MagnaCarta during its first 100 years (mainly Anglo-Norman French and Middle English) Prof Brand - Numbered chapters in the #MagnaCarta began around the 1280s as a way of indexing its content for practical reasons. Prof Paul Brand - Official records of English Royal courts were kept from 1176 and surviving records go back to 1194! #MagnaCarta @katgallow - Certainly, a fascinating history of #MagnaCarta provided by Professor Paul Brand! Prof Brand - #MagnaCarta legacy is more than the survival of medieval legislation. It is the beginning of the English Common Law tradition.

(Cont.) govern from the Aust people, or a segment of them, to whom it is accountable #fedreform #democracy Third principal: Democratic accountability relies on the elected Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States and territories, (cont.) (Cont.) in which public deliberation on significant decisions can take place and through which transparency can be secured #FedReform Fourth principle: #FedReform http://t.co/rvQPu6Cg3j Fifth principle: dealings between levels of govt must be conducted with the mutual respect, trust and good faith that are due to (cont.) (Cont.) to democratically elected representatives of the Aust people #fedreform #democracy Sixth principle: Prof @CherylSaunders1: national standards mean homogeneous standards http://t.co/KEWHLzNgrA @GreenJ: It's a failing how the govts have come together as a group that they can't make a collaborative decision #fedreform #democracy Seventh principle: Prof @CherylSaunders1: Fed Govt raises too much money for constitutional responsibility http://t.co/95AKGLh7Ix Eighth principle: each state is acc to people of the State for the expenditure of public money's derived from public revenues (cont.) (Cont.) raised by the Commonwealth but surplus to its own constitutional responsibilities #FedReform Ninth principle: Prof @CherylSaunders1: we have an obligation to equalise the position of the states to some degree http://t.co/vwGCJFyYzO Tenth principle: actual values underpinning these principles go right through to grassroots level #FedReform http://t.co/YrIQtJK8b1 Prof @CherylSaunders1: Principles drawn up for Australia in the light of experience abroad #FedReform #democracy Prof @CherylSaunders1: if we do believe in #FedReform and #democracy, we should say so Question: How do we reinvigorate democracy?

The Hon Elizabeth Curtain recently joined Melbourne Law School as a new Judge in Residence:  At 6.30pm, we are going to start live-tweeting Clementine Ford's lecture 'Gender Equality &amp; the Law'. Stay tuned.  @clementine_ford's lecture on #gender equality in the #law is set to commence within minutes at #Melbourne Law School. On 'rape culture': rape culture is the social system that has slowly normalized rape - Clementine Ford at MLS. #gender #auspol #auslaw People are still uncomfortable interfering with domestic forms of violence - Clementine Ford at MLS. #gender #auslaw #women Even in the most extreme of situations where the criminal monster..fulfill most of the archetype of what society believes is a rapist..(1/2) ...even then, there's caveats of what a woman should have done (2/2). - Clementine Ford at MLS "Our current strategy of expecting women to be responsible...shifts emphasis from legislative bodies...to that of the social law" (1/2) [The shift to] the need of women to self-regulate as to not disrupt the status quo [is the current strategy] (2/2) - Clementine Ford. "Rape is a gendered crime almost always committed by men" - Clementine Ford at MLS. #gender #women #auspol #auslaw "That's not to say all men are rapists" - Clementine Ford at MLS. #auspol #gender #women "Rape is a crime almost solely experienced by women...the threat of rape isn't something men are taught to live with." - Clementine Ford. "When Canada ran the 'don't be that guy' campaign...shifting responsibility of rape, reported incidents of assault fell down by 10%" - Ford "Something happened, but it wasn't sexual assault, or she consented" is something we tend to hear in relation assault in sport - Ford "Most rapists are known to their victims," not idea that it is a monster in an alleyway - Clementine Ford at MLS. #gender #women #auspol "Consent in the first place, means to some people, giving up your right to say no, to be respected" - Clementine Ford at MLS. #women #gender "Most people can't prove that the person they're in a relationship with raped them so in people's minds it comes to he said she said" - Ford "Informed consent needs to move above and beyond simply securing a yes" (1/2) - Clementine Ford #gender #women #auspol "to a place where it is expected partners will be asking am I treating the person I am having sex with, with dignity and respect" (2/2) "Gender inequality in violence that underpins rape culture [is] in our hands" - Clementine Ford at MLS. #auslaw #women #gender #auspol Need an approach that involves all of society - #law enforcement, law makers, and people - to tackle rape culture, says Clementine Ford. Greater state funding and dedicated law enforcement agencies can make a difference [in tackling rape] - Clementine Ford. #gender #auspol We should not continue to perpetuate old and tired ideas [of rape], and instead focus on increasing law's ability to tackle rape - Ford. "...it is a terrorist act, the ritualized murder of two women every week in #Australia" - Clementine Ford at MLS. #gender #women #auspol "#Women are not peripheral side characters in the lives of men..." - Clementine Ford. "There is privilege and unconscious gender bias" in the legal industry, says Clementine Ford at MLS. #auslaw #auspol #gender #women "For gender equity to truly exist, there needs to be a complete restructure of systems of patriarchal power" - Clementine Ford. #women We need to have equality in all levels of society, says Clementine Ford. #auspol #auslaw "Real action requires real energy, and we need to keep demanding it...no matter how inconvenient people in power find it." - Clementine Ford .@clementine_ford: there is a drive to prioritize men's rights to make mistakes at the expense of #women's rights to live with dignity. "The #law can change. We can change and we can reflect what society needs" - Clementine Ford #women #gender #auspol #auslaw @clementine_ford "Idea that we can't change human behaviour is false" - Clementine Ford at #MLS. #women #gender #law #auspol Clementine Ford at Melbourne Law School speaking about #gender equality and the #law. #auspol #auslaw  "Someone like Adrian Bailey was served...what seems to me as a minimum sentence...because [his victims] were sex workers" - Clementine Ford. #Women have made [rape] visible because of online tools and communicating in ways that is much more difficult to silence - @clementine_ford "I really hate #Facebook...it's a hypocritical platform in lots of ways" - Clementine Ford at MLS. #women #gender #auspol @clementine_ford Melbourne JD student pursues her passion for international #law:  Urfa Masood is set to be #Victoria's first female #Muslim magistrate:  Happening now: #gender-gap bake sale aimed at drawing attention to the pay gap between men and #women in #Australia.  .@CherylSaunders1 says #PNG court ruling on immigration centre to impact Australia @abcnews  Does the international #IP framework need a face-lift?

 Dean Professor Jenny Morgan welcomes Dean Strang to MLS. #StrangAtMLS  We're pleased to welcome #MakingAMurderer lawyer Dean Strang to deliver the 2017 Peter Brett Memorial Lecture. #StrangAtMLS  Watch live on Facebok and join the conversation at #StrangAtMLS  Strang: the common question 'how can you defend those people' reveals a perception of the accused as 'other' #StrangAtMLS "The question is important because it lays bare the widely shared assumption that 'we' do not commit the crimes — 'they' do." #StrangAtMLS Strang: Do we judge people only by the worst thing they have ever done? #StrangAtMLS Strang: Our answer to 'the question' reveals much about ourselves. Are we willing to take action to address disadvantage? #StrangAtMLS  "We defend not just one person, but a system of shared values. In defending one person, we defend all of humanity itself." #StrangAtMLS Strang: As those who study law, we must ask questions broader than those asked of us. #StrangAtMLS #StrangAtMLS: There is a link between liberty and humility, which should make us cautious to our claims of certainty in criminal justice. #StrangAtMLS: Humility in the law critical - outcomes of criminal trials often hinge on testimony, inference, not necessarily science. Strang on empathy: Skills matters hardly at all if lawyers do not see in full the problems that their clients face. #StrangatMLS Law a field in the humanities b/c humanities are 'normative': they ask not just what people do, but what we should do about it #StrangAtMLS "Whatever justice is, it is more qualitative than quantitative. It is more normative than empirical." #StrangAtMLS #StrangAtMLS: We want our lawyers to have a sophisticated understanding of injustice — and to know a reason to defend our people. Audience question: 'so how can you prosecute those people?' Strang: the best prosecutors I know see the accused as human. #StrangAtMLS  MLS Prof Jack Anderson @sportslawMELB thanks Dean Strang for insightful talk on humanity, humility &amp; the humanities in law.  #StrangAtMLS  Missed last night's lecture at MLS?

Bleich, noting he has served over a unique period in Australia - a minority govt & Australia on the UNSC DM: Bleich's term has been marked with a push to deepen ties between US and Australia in defence, trade and education - @USAembassyinOZ Bleich begins, happy to be able to bookend his time with a talk to Australian students - @unimelb @USAembassyinOZ Bleich: When I first came, there were genuine concerns about the alliance. #USAus Bleich: The debate today has completely changed - now we can see the resilience of #US and #Australia. #AmbBleich Bleich: The United States came back stronger than anyone thought - we're now the lost competitive economy. #AmbBleich Bleich: Our trade with #Australia has increased by 40% - #China has only increased 25%. #AmbBleich Bleich: There have also been significant increases in big investments by #US companies in #Australia - GE being the biggest. #AmbBleich Bleich: When I first came to #Australia, people made fun of the #TPP - now it's the biggest trade story in the region. #AmbBleich Bleich: We need to know how partners are developing, they need to know how we're developing to solve problems together. #AmbBleich Bleich: When you add 2.5 bill people to the region you have to meet new needs - food, water, energy - we have to work together. #AmbBleich Bleich: It took us 100 years to work out the road rules - we don't have that time with #Cybersecurity. #AmbBleich Bleich: Confidence in govt and democracy has been falling - particularly in #youth. #AmbBleich Bleich: The change in media is partly the cause of this decrease in confidence. #AmbBleich Bleich: When media sees that young people don't believe in government, they will run those stories. #AmbBleich Bleich: First rule of marketing: never kill the category. We've been killing the category of govt for young people for too long. #AmbBleich Bleich: If we lose that confidence in govt, then we've really lost confidence in ourselves. #AmbBleich #Government Bleich: We can't solve problems of govt if we don't believe in each other. #AmbBleich Bleich: One of the things that has made my job great is seeing that ethic in Americans and Australians alike. #AmbBleich Bleich almost in tears as he recounts the story of Americans helping Australians they've never met. Very heartfelt relationship with #Oz! Questions now taken from the audience: first on the rebalance towards #Asia. #AmbBleich Bleich: We've been investing in, not containing, #China's rise. #AmbBleich Bleich now being asked on the new defence cooperation with bases in #Australia and public pushback. #AmbBleich Question on China and the #TPP - is there room for more partners? #China? Bleich: We're happy to have whoever wants to join, it's a different kind of trade agreement with greater transparency. #AmbBleich Bleich: Transparency will be key to making the region work. #AmbBleich Question now on the focus between Asia and the Middle East. #AmbBleich Bleich: Just because you focus on one area doesn't mean that you turn your back on another. #AmbBleich Questions on #Syria: what is your position on Assad? What's your advice to Australia if intervention does occur? #AmbBleich Bleich: We've been very clear as to what the red lines are - chemical weapons can't be tolerated in any civilized world. #AmbBleich Bleich: #Syria requires a unified response. #AmbBleich Question: was it easier to work with Kevin Rudd or Julia Gillard? #AmbBleich Bleich: I got on well with both! (On Rudd) We had a little bromance going on. #AmbBleich Bleich: I haven't met an Australian I didn't like. #AmbBleich Bleich: (On #US and #Australia) We're friends in the true sense of friends. If Australia succeeds, we feel a sense of happiness. #AmbBleich Bleich: (On PRISM) We don't think that affects our relationship - the headlines don't represent the facts. #AmbBleich Bleich: (On Congress and the budget) We'll pass the budget. Eventually. #AmbBleich Bleich: The GFC has forced us to adapt and become stronger - we're not as polarized. #AmbBleich Final question: how has Australia changed you? #AmbBleich Bleich: I've learned to bite off the end of a Tim Tam and use it with a drink! #AmbBleich Bleich: I've learned that friends care about us, that they worry about us, and they are watching us. #AmbBleich With that, thanks to the Ambassador and @usconsulatemelb @USAembassyinOZ for a fantastic farewell! #AmbBleichpic.twitter.com/PRF9iyv1KD Prof. Tony Coady talks about whether our politicians have a moral deficit: http://www.theage.com.au/comment/politicians-moral-deficit-20130901-2syi1.html … #ausvotes Duncan Green (@fp2p) of @oxfamgb will be speaking at two events in Melbourne on 10 September http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7857631387 … & http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7841428925 … Media dealt cynicism by ABCs Q&A audience tonight, a recurring theme we hear.

Prof. Schultz: News and how it travels has increased in speed for centuries. Prof. Schultz now speaking on how the world's news has reached Australia over its history. The tyranny of distance is now almost invisible. Prof. Schultz: Information is beginning to litter the world. All of it needs to be analyzed and understood. Prof. Schultz: Should we define what we see first and make sense of it later? The surge of information is making it difficult to do more. Prof. Schultz: This is a perfect storm: there is more information to inform decisions in policy but far less time to use it. Prof. Schultz: The certainties of the mass media are gone. There was an ability to regulate, give certainty, and provide impartiality. Prof. Schultz: As audiences fragment in the decline of mass media, outlets have had to try to find controversy to draw readership. Prof. Schultz: Never has so much been said about so little. Prof. Schultz: There are profound changes afoot that we will only come to understand after they have happened. Prof. Schultz: The problems that exist in this change is that we are in between models. Prof. Schultz now discussing how publications like the @GriffithREVIEW can fill a gap in the new media era. Now beginning panel discussion with @luminosityMary on ideas and how to find them in an increasingly noisy world. If a great journal/newspaper is a nation speaking to itself, what does Australia look to? @luminosityMary Ten years ago there was an absence of intellectual leadership from the universities - why? @luminosityMary I think it's because the media stopped calling! @GlynDavisVC Prof. Schultz: True, but attacks on academics in the public domain scared them away. We're in a transformative time with a risk of great blandness - @luminosityMary Prof. Schultz: There is pressure on academics not to engage in risky speculation of ideas. But you can make ideas available for discussion. The development of the @ConversationEDU has bucked the trend of a downturn in ideas and academic writing for a popular audience @GlynDavisVC Maria Tumarkin: The first words that come to a writer are someone else's, the second words are reactive... Take the time to write your own. The development of writers should be to broaden over different genres, something that the @GriffithREVIEW allows. @GlynDavisVC Question: Is there a danger that the internet provides an illusion of the whole world view? Prof. Schultz: There is always that danger. But if we acknowledge the danger exists, we do what we can. Interesting point but compare to what we used to have, how much more we have now is astonishing. @GlynDavisVC Question: is publishing going to change so that the audience can give a direct demand to what they want to read? Universities are facing this question of supply and demand but we need to recognize this kind of publishing is not commercial. @GlynDavisVC @GriffithREVIEW You're welcome! Great event at @unimelb! Tumarkin: The idea of intellectual autonomy is a sacred idea, I wouldn't sacrifice it for anything.

It's in re-thinking what we aim to achieve We need to work with poor countries to provide them energy that's abundant and cheap: a solution that supports their aspirations Charlton: we should embrace some risky or "near perfect" solutions: nuclear, gas given its impractical to rely on renewables for the answer Charlton concludes saying the workable solution has all the available, practical options on the table and disavows the dogmatic Charlton reminds us John Button, who this lecture is named for, took a similar line with industry reform Ross Garnaut in the audience reminds Charlton of unilateral commitments to climate changing policies by China, India, Europe and elsewhere Charlton agrees: a spirit of competition among many countries did appear, but he argues, dwindled after Copenhagen Yung En Chee from @unimelb examines the hidden flaws in the Vic govt's new native vegetation clearing rules http://bit.ly/1hmEVWf  “Micro parties” emerged as the big winners of the 2013 Senate contest http://bit.ly/1g66NjJ  #ausvotes #auspol What can the UN do to address the humanitarian crisis in #Syria?

Lindsay Tanner takes to the podium to introduce Ross Garnaut's #DogDays, published by @BlackIncBooks Tanner says most Australians do not understand how much our lives are shaped by events in, and decisions made by, other countries #DogDays Our students are right now in Birmingham taking their International Public Management subject w/ @DrHDickinson and @politisco Tanner on our economy: It has been artificially charged by the mining boom #DogDays The mining boom isn't permanent, says Tanner. Australians need a wake-up call. #DogDays #DogDays is a broadly accessible, and ultimately good read, says Tanner http://ow.ly/qZXyx  @BlackIncBooks Ross Garnaut takes to the podium now. Jokes that his first draft of #DogDays wasn't very readable! Thanks his editors @BlackIncBooks The evolution of modern global economic development: that's the challenge for the Australian economy, says Garnaut #DogDays Garnaut: Rising living standards are not present in Western countries for the first time. This is a new phenomenon Garnaut: Australia was saved from the worst of the GFC primarily because of the China boom #DogDays Garnaut: The peak of the China resources boom was the second half of 2011 - Oz employment has been steadily slipping since #DogDays Garnaut: Australians face some very big challenges to get through the tough economic times ahead. Strong policy will play a big role... Garnaut: if we get our economic policy wrong, we will see a continued slide in employment and living standards #DogDays Garnaut: the probability is high that reasonably high growth will continue in China #DogDays #auspol Garnaut: But the big structural changes ahead in China could cause 'bumps in the road' for Australia Garnaut: There is a problem of monopoly in financial services in Australia #DogDays #auspol Garnaut: The profit margin of Australian banks are by far the highest in the world #DogDays #auspol Garnaut: Australian banking sector needs competition, not monopoly #DogDays Question to Garnaut: Can Abbott lead us out of the #DogDays? Garnaut: "It is not impossible." Garnaut: But Abbott will need to abandon many of the policy platforms he was elected on, including on climate #DogDays Garnaut: If current Govt. responds to the #DogDays by changing its mind on big policies, we should applaud, not condemn them And on that note, it's a wrap!

Mark Considine chairing the first keynote of the #MSOGAsianCentury Conference, on rethinking public governance - http://ow.ly/i/3XHMW  Prof Haque: #AsianCentury as a theme is new, but increasingly gaining attention from policy makers and academics #MSOGAsianCentury Prof Haque Uni of Singapore discusses Asian development with Robert Bell Regional Head ANZ Prof Shamsul Haque raises important Qs: how will the #AsianCentury affect the international order? Prof Shamsul Haque: who is the main actor behind the rise of Asia? Important debates taking place around this question Prof Haque: Govt needs to be effective to create the #AsianCentury Prof Haque: Is the market or governments the main force in Asian development? Haque: Scholars now looking at the positive sides of the Asian development discourse #MSOGAsianCentury Prof Haque: Asian political leaders view the #AsianCentury not necessarily as a rise, but a 'revival' Prof Haque: What does it mean for the #AsianCentury that many civilians in Asian countries are living in poverty? Asia has become more transnational, says Prof Haque. English is becoming more ubiquitous in Asia, as are Western diets 60% slums around the world are in Asia, says Prof Haque #MSOGAsianCentury Westernisation of Asian cultures means 'Asian Century' less Asian than the term implies Prof Haque: Asian countries done much to fight poverty, but many Asian countries still marred by inequality Why are people attracted to the idea of a 'miracle' #AsianCentury? Asks Prof Haque #MSOGAsianCentury why is the Asian Century such a captivating idea apart from economics? The discourse on #AsianCentury has been predominately framed in materialist terms, says Prof Haque Along with embracing opportunities, we need to be cautious and critical about the concept of #AsianCentury as well, says Prof Haque Robert Bell of #ANZ now speaking on the need to build Asia's capability across the workforce #MSOGAsianCentury @jikon Which supports Prof Haque's point about homogenisation & transnationalisation of the region and Qn this presents for defining 'Asia' Bell now running an activity on how big the regional challenge is for ANZ #MSOGAsianCentury http://ow.ly/i/3XIhi  Bell speaking of ANZ's Asia Pacific Business Development Program as great training to help businesses understand the region #AsianCentury Bell: ANZ Super Regional iPad app a great way to engage with the market in Asia #MSOGAsianCentury Robert Bell stresses the importance of staff members being Asia-literate in order to breakdown barriers and connect with the region Arts Dean Mark Considine opens the floor now to questions Decentralised local govt effective in Western countries. But local governments in Asia often have weaknesses, says Prof Haque Do you have a question for Prof Haque or Robert Bell? Tweet them to #MSOGAsianCentury Banks play an important role in market participation in developing countries, ensuring they remain relevant, says Robert Bell Great Q from the audience: How can we make sure that the Asian Century is going to happen & that we take advantage of its opportunities? Prof Haque: Not everyone is gaining from the economic development agenda in Asia. Inequality has also accompanied progress & growth Bell: The Asian Century is a reality. ANZ wants to participate and help shape the growth in Asia Question from audience about the story of growth in Asia, what are some of the negative consequences? #MSOGAsianCentury is 'Asian Century' really about economic gain for Western nations at poor nations' expense? eg Bangladesh garment industry Prof Haque: NGOs have become among the biggest businesses in the world, though supposed to be non-profit Question from @JohnLangmore: is it necessary to first have economic growth before Asia provides improved well being to its populations? Bell: ANZ has a consistent set of policies across Asia to help assist the emerging middle class in developing countries .@Sara_Bice Our pleasure! We love Qs - keep them coming! Asian Century growth should also sustain the growth of the 'Human Century' & the 'Environment Century', says Prof Haque #MSOGAsianCentury indonesian economic growth too rapid for social and cultural evolution to keep up so business interests dominate Question: what are the dilemmas the states are facing in their development role? #MSOGAsianCentury Final words: Capital always goes to where it is welcome, says Bell. Industry and Government need to work closely together #MSOGAsianCentury #MSOGAsianCentury Robert Bell: industry and government must work closely together to ensure economic development complements social RT @IPAAVic: #msogasiancentury - what does business want from Oz public administration in Asian Century? A great question for later! And that's a wrap for the first plenary! Join us from 11.15am where we will continue debating the #AsianCentury in a policy context @castaritaHK @mahgnilleb @Sara_Bice @HelenCSullivan defining the 'Asian Century' in a contemporary policy context at the #MSOGAsianCentury @castaritaHK the diverse region makes it hard to define Asian in any kind of black and white terms #MSOGAsianCentury @castaritaHK There is no current balance of power in the Asia, BoP is needed to achieve political stability #MSOGAsianCentury David Bellingham now speaking on the impact of the Asian Century. What is it? And who does it belong to? #MSOGAsianCentury @mahgnilleb @mahgnilleb contextual aspects of defining Asia are incredibly important. Does religious solidarity (or lack thereof) have a role to play? Until recently, 'Asia' was not a term used by local populations within Asia, says Bellingham 'Asia' incredibly difficult to define, so how then do we define the #AsianCentury asks Bellingham @mahgnilleb Asian urbanisation involves the moment of around 40 million people a year - wow! #MSOGAsianCentury @mahgnilleb The only consistency of inconsistency when defining the 'Asian Century' #MSOGAsianCentury @jiehyunglo We agree! Glad you're enjoying our updates. We'll be tweeting from #MSOGAsianCentury all day today and tomorrow. @mahgnilleb The Asian Century 2012 White Paper provided the opportunity for interaction and displayed sensitivity #auspol #MSOGAsianCentury Very well surmised @mahgnilleb - 'We need cultural empathy' is the central thesis of his forthcoming research #MSOGAsianCentury .@Sara_Bice speaking now on a research agenda for public policy in the #AsianCentury Bice also points to importance of definitions: What do we mean by the 'Asian Century?' And how do we define public policy? Bice points to an important shift in the public policy literature towards publication by more non-Western authors But there is also a lack of Western scholarship on the Asian Century, says Bice. Need for two-way collaborative scholarship btw West & Asia Bice: Must look beyond Anglo-Saxon paradigms in our public policy research. Incorporate globally diverse views and perspectives in research .@HelenCSullivan Public policy management looks different in Indonesia and US for example, as they are informed by different values unique .. to the country context. Points to the ways cultural values influences public policy scholarship. The floor is opened to questions now Have any questions for @castaritaHK @mahgnilleb @Sara_Bice or @HelenCSullivan on defining the Asian Century? Tweet us at #MSOGAsianCentury .@jikon 'Lucky' being the operative word in that sentence @JanineOFlynn @jikon Yes! Big bright orange umbrellas to insert a pop of colour into those grey, cloudy days Andrew Walter: Are there any areas of public policy where the region can shift from rule-takers to rule-makers? #MSOGAsianCentury @Sara_Bice there are instances where innovative public policy responses have served well. The health sector serves as a good example. Question: Does regional policy integration need to be incremental, as it was in the EU? #MSOGAsianCentury If you want to hear more from Mark Triffitt, listen to him back on Radio National yesterday http://ow.ly/28H8ai  #MSOGAsianCentury Fmr Vic Premier John Brumby is about to launch Ross Garnaut's latest book, 'Dog Days' @blackincbooks Read more about Garnaut's Dog Days here http://www.blackincbooks.com/books/dog-days  via @blackincbooks Brumby: There a lot of challenges still for Australia in weathering the ongoing impacts of the GFC Brumby points to some of the challenges for Oz: health expenditure, receding mining boom, ageing population, commonwealth-state relations Garnaut's book tells us that there are tough choices for policymakers in responding to these challenges, says Brumby Ross Garnaut speaking now Prof Garnaut touching how Australia became largely uncompetitive in all sectors other than mining http://ow.ly/i/3XMgh  #MSOGAsianCentury Garnaut: The continual decline of the boom since 2011 has seen a constant downgrading in state and federal forecasts #MSOGAsianCentury Garnaut: govt. rode the tiger of huge investment, but now will only survive if it puts the tiger back into the cage #MSOGAsianCentury About to start the next session on 'State Responses to the Asian Century' focussing on the 1st Murdoch Commission http://ow.ly/i/3XMIR  John Brumby says China is changing dramatically, therefore how Oz perceives it's relationship with China must change as well Read The First Murdoch Commission online here http://ow.ly/28Heoj  #MSOGAsianCentury Michael Crozier of Murdoch Uni: the Commission furthers WA's desires to enhance mutual benefit and long-term resilience #MSOGAsianCentury Crozier: Commission highlights the need to be mindful of differences, as well as commonalities, in our region #MSOGAsianCentury Crozier: Oz needs to see itself as an engaged, active economic participant within the Asia region - not just a country that exports to Asia @jikon Uh oh, time to break out those orange ponchos John McCarthy speaking about Chpt 5, 'Engagement and Diplomacy' - Australia's position is challenging given the difference in cultures McCarthy: we need to think about LT relationships btw businesses and institutions, and how important they are to maintain #MSOGAsianCentury #MSOGAsianCentury Ambassador Alan Oxley: separation of politics from legal system is relatively recent in most Asian countries McCarthy: we only put serious effort in when there is a problem that needs sorting out & not enough done btw these times #MSOGAsianCentury McCarthy: relationships should be people to people more so than simply government to government #MSOGAsianCentury McCarthy: States have more foreign policy input than first thought. Education, labour reg & regulation on the ground #MSOGAsianCentury Kerry Sanderson AO: Most people in Australia know too little about Asia. But many Asian popns also have little knowledge of Australia Sanderson: We need to promote greater awareness of Australia in Asia, and promote two-way investments #MSOGAsianCentury Sanderson: We need to promote greater study of Asia at home, but also see ourselves as part of the Asian region #MSOGAsianCentury Sanderson: The Asian way of doing business is to develop relationships first. In this respect, Australia has lessons to learn Q&A time! Ultimately, building long-term relationships are crucially important to Australian relations with Asian countries says Brumby Question: how can Victoria best capture the multicultural nature of the city to engage with the wider region? McCarthy: much of this happens organically, though established communities, and this should not be regulated too much #MSOGAsianCentury #MSOGAsianCentury Prof Andrew Mitchell asks Ambassador Oxley to comment on Asian investment in Australia #MSOGAsianCentury Oxley: Austn international investment policy confused Education is being raised as a vital way to improve knowledge of Asia in Australia, including Asian language literacy The inevitable Q about alliance has come up: What does Australia's r/s with Asia mean for alliance with US? John McCarthy argues that Australia will never, nor should, dramatically shift away from US alliance. US alliance will remain crucial aspect of our foreign policy. But this not necessarily bad for our r/s with Asia, says McCarthy But it is problematic that within Asia we are often not seen as having an independent view from the US, says McCarthy Here we are at the final session of the day! #MSOGAsianCentury Peter Harris Chair of Productivity Commission chairing discussion with Vic Heads of DFAT & IPAA Speakers: Dr Geraldine Kennett and David Hanna @IPAAVic, Prof Deborah Youdell from University of Belingham, John Richardson @dfat Peter Harris AO, Chairman Productivity Commission with Aus Govt is Chairing the discussion #MSOGAsianCentury Speakers will debate the Q: What are the implications of the Asian Century for policy making and practice? #MSOGAsianCentury #MSOGAsianCentury David Hanna IPAA: Aus gov needs to be more adroit, open & respectful in its dealing w Asia #MSOGAsianCentury Hanna: Aus has underlying arrogance in how it deals with Asia - more genuine and obvious respect needed #MSOGAsianCentury Hanna: signs of this occurring are good: flexibility and willingness to learn being demonstrated by Australians Hanna: White Paper whilst archived still has relevance to the new govt, and the public sector should be willing to assist #MSOGAsianCentury #MSOGAsianCentury Hanna: Aus gov will need good advice on how to do this, public service needs skills and capacity to provide it John Richardson: Asian Century, whilst an overused phrase, provides a useful shorthand for times such as this #MSOGAsianCentury Conference Richardson: language skills do not simply make one 'Asia literate', much more is required #MSOGAsianCentury @dfat ....this requires both public and private sector capability, with a more sophisticated understanding #MSOGAsianCentury New Colombo Plan launches tomorrow: increased investment in Aus students studying in Asia: http://dfat.gov.au/new-colombo-plan … A unique characteristic Australia brings to its r/s with Asia is it's dynamic multicultural society, says Richardson #MSOGAsianCentury Prof Youdell Birmingham: racism in Aus and UK endures although more subtle Geraldine Kennett CEO @IPAAVic will talk now about the linkages between the Asian Century and the public policy workforce in Vic Kennett: wouldn't it be great to stop trying to understand "the other" but for Australians and Asians to see each other as beings, equals It's the last Q&A session of the day. Do you have any questions for the speakers? Send us your Qs to #MSoGAsianCentury @JohnLangmore - I am astounded to hear that the Government has only 1 staff member per 17 million 'Asians'. What can be done to increase? Hanna: it is an issue of importance, and requires us to change the national discussion away from mere budget constraints #MSOGAsianCentury Question: the White Paper speaks of more consuls in Asia, how is this progressing? #MSOGAsianCentury Richardson: it is more about of looking at the overall process, in particular the merging of AusAid and DFAT #MSOGAsianCentury Question from audience member: Who is in and who is out when it comes to defining the Asian Century - where are 'Asia's' geographic limits? Mark Considine wrapping up day 1 of our conference Considine: key theme of day was connectedness. He predicts this will make us all more intellectually & culturally diverse Considine: this may contrast with less diversity economically Helen Sullivan: an undercurrent of the day is troubled sense some have that parties have inbuilt agendas, but do they? Sullivan: discussions today have leaned towards broadening of thinking which counters notions of pre-set agendas Sullivan: nervousness, anxiety of Australians about the idea of 'Asian Century' is clear RT A nice summation @JanineOFlynn: Day 1 at the #MSoGAsianCentury conference: http://storify.com/JanineOFlynn/what-s-happening-at-the-melbourne-school-of-govern?utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&utm_content=storify-pingback&utm_source=t.co&utm_campaign=&awesm=sfy.co_fXWe … - halfway there, let's go Day 2!

China's GDP grew from USD $1.2 trillion in 2000 to $8.23 trillion in 2012 #MSOGAsianCentury The system of public finance in #China matters says Wong; it has critical effects on economic, political and social outcomes Financial reform in China has been 'crossing the river by groping at stones' says Professor Wong #MSOGAsianCentury Since 1980 #China 's urban popn has grown by 500 million. 211 million added during 2000-2010 alone #MSOGAsianCentury Wong: Chinese cities have done very well to thrive in harsh economic times. The vast improvement in services is something to be credited Wong: McDonald's has an 'anti-aircraft defence' levy in China! Who would have thought #MSOGAsianCentury #China Wong: The CCP's 3rd Plenum looked at problems of mismatch btw responsibilities and revenues of municipal governments #MSOGAsianCentury Australia would like to see #China get on a more sustainable path to growth, says Wong #MSOGAsianCentury Wong: can humpty-dumpty be put back together again? #MSOGAsianCentury Wong: local govt debt needs to be reigned in, and more oversight on extrabudgetary revenues is needed to do so #MSOGAsianCentury After 3 decades of rapid growth and structural change, the Chinese economy has outgrown it's fiscal system says Wong #MSOGAsianCentury Prof David Kelly takes to the podium now Kelly will be discussing China's policy environment at the rate of one slide per minute! #MSOGAsianCentury Kelly: Despite the #china constitution being conceived w.o. the presence of a CCP it is where all key decision making lies #MSOGAsianCentury Many think of #China as a one party state. Not untrue, but policy in China is actively debated says Kelly #MSOGAsianCentury Have any questions for David Kelly or Christine Wong? Remember that you can tweet your questions to #MSOGAsianCentury Kelly: juxtapos btw Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang - one talks of aspirational goals, whilst the other problem solving #MSOGAsianCentury #China Unsurprisingly the Chinese State pension scheme disproportionately favour government employees, says Kelly #MSOGAsianCentury @amitabhmattoo RT @IPAAVic: q for prof Wong given off budget borrowing by LICs + under-reporting how confident are you in Chinese eco stats? Kelly in conclusion: after breaking it down, Chinese policy process is not all that alien, social divides play a key role #MSOGAsianCentury Great Q - RT @PooleAvery: pls say more re urban sprawl in poorer cities - if apt bldgs finished, would they be occupied? #MSoGAsianCentury +1 RT @JanineOFlynn: @amitabhmattoo Great chair especially pulling questions from twitter sphere #MSoGAsianCentury Wong on local govt debt: govt will not undertake reform unless desperate. LG debt est at $20tril but cannot turn off tap, #MSOGAsianCentury Wong: .....does this constitute a desparate situation? It is like squeezing a balloon, how long can it last? #MSOGAsianCentury The endless empty blocks of housing blocks in China show the disengagement of market forces, says Kelly #MSoGAsianCentury Money is made from the building of sprawling apartment blocks, but not from people living in them. disconnect between demand and supply. Kelly: does the shortage of housing mean ghost cities will be filled? No. Not responding to market forces, too expensive #MSOGAsianCentury @IPAAVic Thanks for your question! We just posed it to Prof Wong Prof Wong: how reliable are any economic statistics?! National stats more reliable than sub-national stats in China #MSOGAsianCentury @amitabhmattoo posed 'is there going to be a Chinese Arab Spring'? Wong: don't count on the middle class here! #MSOGAsianCentury Kelly: there are social changes afoot, but this doesn't translate into power shifts #MSOGAsianCentury Wong: China hires tens of thousand of bloggers to 'guide' the national discussion that happens via social media #wow #MSoGAsianCentury A fascinating opening session chaired by @amitabhmattoo on Chinese public policy. Looking forward to the rest of the #MSOGAsianCentury @PooleAvery chairing the session on Governance Mechanisms for the 'Asian Century' #MSOGAsianCentury Dr Bruno Zeller speaking on FTAs & in particular regulatory harmonisation btw & within States #MSOGAsianCentury A recurrent theme arising from #MSoGAsianCentury: Asia is *not* homogenous.

Look at the concentration in the room as we hang off his every wordpic.twitter.com/OB5rFEXwUB The book is about the governance signals that academics receive, and how to research with this in mind, says Jenny Lewis #MSOGAsianCentury Lewis: More than 500 interviews over 3 years(!) look at different policy institutions in nations around the world #MSOGAsianCentury Looking forward to the session on the 'Asian Century' and the EU, Assoc Prof Bruno Mascitelli & Prof Bruce Wilson open #MSOGAsianCentury Wilson: the economic dimension of the Asian Century is only one area of consideration, we must take much more into account #MSOGAsianCentury Wilson: The Austro-centric 2012 White Paper needs to give way to the reality of the situation, Aust is not the only player #MSOGAsianCentury Even whilst in crisis, the EU continues to dominate FDI and has an expanding single market (<500million), says Wilson #MSOGAsianCentury The term BRIC originated in the offices of Goldman Sachs! #whoknew #MSOGAsianCentury Profs Beeson & Stone now on the role of the EU model in a post-crisis Asia.

Jensen notes that teamwork is key to improve understanding about the complex issues that today's societies face #MSoGAsianCentury We also need to build better bridges between the policy community and the research community. #MSoGAsianCentury Cooperation is also key: we can't stay in our own silos anymore says Jensen #MSoGAsianCentury Jensen: The emergence of big data and e-government rises from a need for more sophisticated policy evaluation techniques #MSOGAsianCentury @JohnLangmore to the fore. What people want from govts is to improve their security. To work on that is a considerable opp #MSOGAsianCentury Insecurities are all around us, more rigorous analysis of what is req to combat these is now what's needed @JohnLangmore #MSOGAsianCentury Threats to the welfare state could tear at the social fabric of our nation #MSOGAsianCentury @JohnLangmore More research required into the powers of the PM & executive.

But how do we work together? @Sara_Bice asks #MSOGAsianCentury, great Q In response to the Q RT @DrHDickinson: Jensen: one of my key roles will involve being a broker and an agent of change #MSOGAsiancentury Thoughtful closing remarks from @HelenCSullivan reminding us to simultaneously unsettle and be unsettled #MSOGAsianCentury Thank you to everyone that attended our #MSOGAsianCentury, it has been an jam-packed but enjoyable couple of days, see you all again soon!

We are a rich country and stable multicultural society #AUSfederalism Brumby: does no accept the government's assessment of Australia's federation by the current federal gov. Brumby: Our success is not by chance. It is due to the system of government. We are able to adapt in challenging times #AUSfederalism Brumby: Does Federation still work in the 21st Century? Absolutely it does. #AUSfederalism Brumby: Federalism works, even it is based on a system drawn up over 100 years ago #AUSfederalism Brumby: Federalism offers separation of powers and it allows for creativity  #AUSfederalism Brumby: Many important new policies are trialled by States and later adopted nationally #AUSfederalism Brumby: Our Federal model means that cooperation is needed with one or more of the states and territories  #AUSfederalism Brumby: There is some inefficiency. States use different rail systems, different WH&S laws and different regulatory bodies #AUSfederalism Brumby: Power is divided by the   states and the Commonwealth. However, there is a 'vertical mismatch' - mostly over taxes #AUSfederalism Brumby: The Commonwealth is often tempted to take over areas controlled by the states. #AUSfederalism Brumby: our federation has become increasingly out of balance. We need to better align responsibilities with revenues #AUSfederalism Brumby: It makes sense for the states to manage health and education, while allowing the Commonwealth to manage defence #AUSfederalism Brumby: The current level of GST is insufficient to fill in income imbalances #AUSfederalism Brumby: The Commonwealth should include GST on foreign purchased items via the internet #AUSfederalism @unimelb @MelbLawSchool Brumby: We can get Federation right by managing rights, revenue and cooperation. #AUSfederalism @unimelb Time for Q & A - what questions do you have for John Brumby? #AUSfederalism @unimelb Q&A: Is it enough for premiers to state a 'line in the sand' in reply to the federal govt abolishing the COAG reform council? #AUSfederalism Q&A: What are your comments on the changes to Charities Commission? #AUSfederalism Brumby: The cuts to health spending in the #Budget2014 dramatic. Hence, the premiers are angered  #AUSfederalism @unimelb Brumby: If I was a state premier, I would put up my hand & ask for an increase in the GST #AUSfederalism #Budget2014 @unimelb Q&A: there's oportunity to fix up imbalance between State & Fed revenue that's been brought into focus by the federal budget #AUSfederalism Brumby: The states could increase other taxes - stamp duty, car registration etc. But this is a small base #AUSfederalism @unimelb Brumby: Raising the GST fixes the the funds of the Federation. #AUSfederalism @unimelb Q: Where does local government fit into the Federation? #AUSfederalism @unimelb A: Local government would also likely benefit from a rise in the GST #AUSfederalism @unimelb Q&A: Giving States more revenue to meet growing responsiblities doesn't mean no national standards for health, educ etc #AUSfederalism Q&A:will increased State power mean a race to the bottom for education and health?  #AUSfederalism Brumby: mimimum standards qn is an isuue that needs more discussion in context of white paper on commonwealth-state relations #AUSfederalism Q&A: will more negotiation get us where we need to go, or do we need to change the Constitution? #AUSfederalism Brumby: Changing the Constitution is hard. Cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth is essential #AUSfederalism @unimelb Q&A:how do we protect low income people if GST base/rate increases?  #AUSfederalism Q&A: for the elderly, can compensate by increasing pension, changing means tests #AUSfederalism Brumby: Low income earners will feel a sudden increase. But I think you can increase their Gov funds appropriately #AUSfederalism @unimelb Brumby: for low income young poeple, evidence shows most will not remain in the vulnerable group long term #AUSfederalism Brumby: Young educated people can afford to pay an increased GST as over their working life they will receive a higher income #AUSfederalism Wrap up by Prof Helen Sullivan of Brumby's address: an impressively deep & broad grasp of financial and non-finaical issues #AUSfederalism And we're done.

You can follow our tweets using #ipaavic http://www.ipaavicsummit.org.au  Summit host & Prof @JanineOFlynn is about to speak #ipaavic .@JanineOFlynn: The summit this year is focused on the theme 'new horizons' - we will consider the future of public administration #ipaavic The summit begins with a presentation by @CSIROnews' Dr Stefan Hajkowicz discussing the megatrends that will impact public service delivery Dr Stefan: @CSIROnews identified 6 mega trends - the first, 'more from less'. There will be increasing demand for limited resources Dr Stefan: the second, the status of the world's biodiversity. Today more species are under threat #ipaavic Dr Stefan: But, the good news is that people are doing more than they've ever done before to preserve species and the environment #ipaavic Dr Stefan: the third, 'silk highway' - there is, and will continue to be, rapid economic growth in Asia and the developing world #ipaavic Dr Stefan: the fourth, our ageing population. There will be rising healthcare expenditure & changed retirement models #ipaavic Melbourne School of Government (@Government_UoM) professor @JanineOFlynn is hosting the two-day #ipaavic conference.pic.twitter.com/TfFpk4ycDq Dr Stefan: the fifth - thanks to new info technology, we are all increasingly connected, which impacts all aspects of our lives #ipaavic Dr Stefan: we are observing an exponential growth in information technology #ipaavic Dr Stefan: finally, the rise of the experience economy. As we see income growth, consumer & social expectations for services become greater Dr Stefan: spending choices are growing. When people buy coffee some people consider whether its fair-trade and how its produced. #ipaavic Dr Stefan: We must understand Asian spending choices to profit from the global economic shift from west to east. #ipaavic Dr Stefan: Diversifying our Asian exports beyond resources to services and food produce is key to a resilient economy. #ipaavic Dr Stefan: these mega trends point to the need for innovation. Australia should be a country of ideas as we head into the future #ipaavic Big round of applause for Dr Stefan as he wraps up his presentation. What a great start to the summit #ipaavic Hey @IPAAVic, are you able to tweet about where people can find the summit app? Thanks! The panel: Turbulence can be a boon not a burden. Australia can ride the rip - but carefully. There is no room for complacency. #ipaavic @DianeAlca thanks! Andrew Tongue: The challenge is to encourage our skilled people to think creatively and have our organisations embrace new ideas #ipaavic Tim Orton: Australia is well placed to manage turbulence because of our diversity. We just need to learn how to profit. #ipaavic @NousGroup If you're at the #ipaavic summit today you can submit Qs to the panellists via the event app. Download here: http://eventmobi.com/ipaavicsummit/  @IPAAVic Andrew Tongue: In Victoria, only 20% of electronic public  services can be completed online. That is the worst of all states. #ipaavic Question to Dr Stefan: What makes Asia better at public administration? #ipaavic Response by Dr Stefan: Investment in public services and infrastructure is much higher. Investment in education is also critical. #ipaavic Gill Callister: Public housing policy has changed. It was on helping low income people to self sufficiency. Now its a last resort #ipaavic Panel is now taking questions from the audience #ipaavic Q: is the public service too risk adverse? How can we encourage greater risk-taking? A: Andrew Tongue - Sometimes we are risk when critical services are at stake. However, we could set our risk tolerance more fine #ipaavic Q:  what are the preconditions for achieving a single unitary vic public service? A: Bill Shields - The greatest experience we've had was due to the September 11 attacks, when we consolidated 23 agencies together #ipaavic Q: does economic equality equate to a happier society? What do mega trends tell us about the happiness factor? Q: to Andrew Tongue - what is the public sector doing to develop new capabilities among the public service? A: Stefan Hajkowicz - These are the upcoming trends. It's our choice whether we'll manage these trends toward a happier society #ipaavic Tongue: we have to work at multiple levels, giving staff new opportunities & skills training. I'd like to see vast improvements in 3 yrs Drop by our Melbourne School of Government booth and say hello! #ipaavicpic.twitter.com/v2XXZfedM5 The next session is about to begin - topic for discussion: 'Road Testing a Reform Agenda' #ipaavic Penny Armytage from @kpmgaustralia is talking about reform in the public service Penny Armytage: Responding to funding cuts, Manchester city established an innovative investment campaign. Now replicated throughout the UK. Penny Armytage: The dialogue with the community in the UK provides a good case for how Australia can progress its discourse #ipaavic Penny Armytage: Are we getting a good return on our investment? Well, if we provide more public information we'll progress policy #ipaavic Brendan Flynn: We should encourage innovation from the ground up - not necessarily just supporting clever people from Spring St #ipaavic Adrian Robb: Community expectations for services continually rise. We should work through solutions & not over promise on results #ipaavic Brendan Flynn: The level of government closest to providing the service should provide that service. #ipaavic Question from the audience: in a competitive budget environment, how would you make the case that the public sector can do better? Penny Armytage: If we want considered deliberation about policy, we need to encourage local communities to contribute to the debate #ipaavic Penny Armytage: There must be space for creative thinkers in the public sphere. That's the challenge to creating innovative policy #ipaavic Next seminar is just beginning 'View from the Chief's Office' #ipaavic What does the public service look like from the Chiefs office? The question for discussion for the panel #ipaavic Colin Radford: The Chief of staff should always complement the minister's office #ipaavic On staff: Phil Martin says talent is hugely important, big reforms can't happen without a switched on public service #ipaavic Colin Radford: One recommendation is getting better flow between the political staff and the bureaucracy #ipaavic "Public service is not a career, it's a vocation. It's something you do because you fundamentally believe in it & want to affect change" Previous tweet was quote from Colin Radford, fmr Chief of Staff to Vic Minister for Finance, Tim Holding Colin Radford: The public & private sector have common  goals - to advance policies. But it's easy to get distracted by the media #ipaavic Panel throwing to Qs from the floor #ipaavic Phil Martin: The Chief of Staff must remember not to be the Minister. They are representing the office and are unelected. #ipaavic Colin Radford: We can say that in Victoria we have a non-partisan public service. That helps to get unbiased advice #ipaavic Q: Is being in government & politics a young persons' game? Martin: it is difficult to balance family life w/ being a chief of staff. Job involves long working hours, which favours younger people Radford: But along with energy and enthusiasm, experience is also essential. Balance is important here New break out seminar on 'Design and Performance' with Cath Smith, Richard Rawling & Jo Gatehouse #ipaavic Richard Rawling: Effective design needs to connect your internal and external worlds #ipaavic Richard Rawling: If you can find the shared interests among many organisations then it's easier to design a supportive project #ipaavic Jo Gatehouse from Eastern Health: Drawing on consumer feedback is an useful approach when improving organisational performance. #ipaavic Jo Gatehouse: By redesigning our focus on greater patient's concerns we've reduced hospital overnight stays #ipaavic Jo Gatehouse: Changing staff culture took time but it was overall beneficial to advancing productivity #ipaavic One emerging theme we've noticed at #ipaavic: the importance of the public sector engaging with the grassroots & local communities Cath Smith: Listening to consumers can be seen as tokenistic. Its actually changing culture that's key to improving organisations #ipaavic Jo Gatehouse: A quick fix is not really possible. Redesigning an organisation's new approach/methodology requires patience #ipaavic Richard Rawling: A relatively simple change can knock the system into new thinking #ipaavic And that's it for the 'Design & Performance' #ipaavic Next topic for discussion: How do you build a high performing workplace that makes maximum use of its talent pool? #ipaavic Patricia Faulkner AO, chair of the board of @superpartners is presenting Faulkner is discussing the gender disparity within senior positions in the public service workforce. Where are the women? #ipaavic Patricia Faulkner: Obtaining data on women in top Vic public service positions is difficult because there is no dataset #ipaavic Faulkner: Studies have found that there is little gender discrimination. But promotion trends shows a small trend against women #ipaavic Faulkner: The small gender discrimination at top Vic public service positions could be related to demographics #ipaavic Faulkner's key findings: 60% of the staff in the Vic DPC are women, but only about 30% of women hold top positions #ipaavic Faulkner: Why is it important that we have gender equality in the workplace? Because diversity in leadership is important #ipaavic Faulkner: Companies where women are well represented in top positions are also companies that perform the best #ipaavic Faulkner: the problem is not Australian alone. The gender gap is prevalent in countries across the world. #ipaavic Do we have a problem with a gendered culture of leadership? Interesting questions #ipaavic Faulkner: We shouldn't be satisfied with reaching 40% of women at the top - we should be aiming for 60% #ipaavic Big round of applause for Patricia Faulker as we now move to Q&A #ipaavic Does the answer lie in quotas? Faulkner says as a second step, they may be useful. But not as a first solution #ipaavic Q from the audience: what advice would Faulkner give to job seekers from minority and ethnic backgrounds? #ipaavic Faulkner: we should have increased representation of refugees & migrants in workforce. Reporting on numbers will aid clarity on this issue This session with Patricia Faulkner has just wrapped up #ipaavic Up next, Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay will be discussing the Victoria Police Blue Paper #ipaavic Lay: There's been quite a lot of public discussion about the Vic police blue paper, but it's been good for the Vic police #ipaavic Lay: The paper is a call to reconsider how we can best work to keep our community safe in the face of today's challenges #ipaavic Lay: The Blue Paper is about change. We can't follow the same path as we have done for decades #ipaavic Lay: public reactions to the Blue Paper are a clear indication that reform of the Vic police will be difficult #ipaavic Lay: the Blue Paper is not a call for the mass closure of police stations #ipaavic Lay: It has been reported that the Blue Paper is the greatest Vic police reform in 50 years #ipaavic Lay: Isn't it my job to alert govt & the community that without reform, the police will struggle to meet tomorrow's challenges? #ipaavic Lay: Victoria police is not alone. Australia Post is also undergoing a rapid change against new technologies and environments #ipaavic Lay: The operations of the Vic police have remained unchanged. Reform is long overdue #ipaavic Lay: the Paper makes a clear case that there is a mismatch between patterns of demand & allocation of resources #ipaavic Lay: To achieve change, we need to better match resources to demand. Preventing crime is one way to reduce front line resources #ipaavic Lay: we must focus on community engagement #ipaavic Lay: I accept that change is difficult. Now, I look forward to the public sector discussion #ipaavic Lay: Electing police community leaders, as they do in the UK, is not something Vic police will pursue #ipaavic And that's a wrap for the day. Tomorrow, we'll be live tweeting again for day 2 of the conference #ipaavic Today, we are also at the #Alliance21 conference in Canberra hosted by  @Alliance__21 & @USSC. Live streamed via http://alliance21.org.au/ . Prof Bates Gill, CEO of @USSC @unisydney, says the #Alliance21 project is advancing the US-Aus alliance into the 21st century. John Berry, US Ambassador to Australia, says the #rebalance has a defence component. But there is so much more. #Alliance21 @USAembassyinOZ John Berry: The axis of the world for 2014 has shifted toward Australia's advantage. #Alliance21 @USAembassyinOZ @Alliance__21 @USSC Danny Russell from US @StateDept says despite division within domestic American politics, the US is committed to Australia #alliance21 Maj Gen Richard Simcock says we welcome Australia's development of a more mature maritime capability #Alliance21 @Alliance__21 @USSC Maj Gen Richard Simcock says #cyberwarfare is the battle space of now. Australia should not underinvest. #alliance21 @Alliance__21 @USSC Roy K. from #Chevron Australia says the supply of Australian #LNG gas to Asian houselolds will be key to keeping the lights on. #alliance21 Hon. Martin Ferguson - we should not just focus on our natural resources, we should be investing in innovation #alliance21 @alliance__21 Phew! We're back from Canberra now & returning to our coverage of the #ipaavic summit. To follow more from #alliance21, follow @PickHeath .@PickHeath doing some excellent tweeting of the #alliance21 conference taking place in Canberra today @alliance__21 We're looking forward to livetweeting the 2nd day of #ipaavic. We begin the day with a discussion on the public sector in the #asiancentury Participating in this discussion: Jason Chang, Louise McGrath, Justin Hanney, our director @HelenCSullivan, with David Hanna as host Justin Hanney: People born in China, India and Asia generally are vastly underrepresented in the Aus public sector #ipaavic .@HelenCSullivan: how do you go about building the capabilities of the public service to become Asia-literate? #ipaavic More focus needed on teaching Asian languages in schools #ipaavic Hanney: we tend to think we have so much to teach to Asian societies, and we do, but we also have much to learn from them #ipaavic .@HelenCSullivan: we also tend to think of our relationships with Asian societies as purely economic ones #ipaavic .@HelenCSullivan: but it's difficult to build long-term relationships with this perspective, economic ties are just one piece of the puzzle Hanna: we also shouldn't limit ourselves to an Asian focus; Australia needs to open itself globally & be more engaged in the world #ipaavic Hanna: key to building longterm relations with Asian states? Ask not how Aus can benefit, but how the relationship can benefit both sides .@HelenCSullivan: the Melbourne School of Govt. is a global school. One third of our students are international students #ipaavic .@HelenCSullivan: The Melbourne School of Govt is committed to an international education for its students #ipaavic Fascinating discussion about public policy in Asian century. Moving on now to our next session. It's a good one! See you again in 5 minutes The public sector meets the literary world: our next session is hosted by @MelbWritersFest's @lisadempster #ipaavic Panellists: Fran Thorn, Graeme Head, Dean Yates, Katy Haire #ipaavic Panellists will be discussing their favourite books and how they resonate with the work that they do #ipaavic Fran Thorn has chosen Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantle Thorn: Wolf Hall could almost be a primer for the public service, in particular a secretary role #ipaavic By the end of this session you'll have a few new books to add to your reading list #ipaavic Graeme Head has chosen The Sirian Experiments by Doris Lessing #ipaavic Head: this book explores power structures, human nature and behaviour. The Sirian Experiments sounds like a good book to read for all those budding politicians out there #ipaavic Dean Yates has chosen a true classic: To Kill a Mockingbird #ipaavic Yates: this book teaches you how to be a leader, how to work within the system, how to stick to your values & morals #ipaavic Yates: Atticus Finch is a great model of leadership and how to be a strong leader in difficult circumstances  #ipaavic Haire: Literature can tell us a lot about how we ought to live. There are many lessons for public servants to discern from books #ipaavic .@lisadempster: literature has always been a great avenue for political agitation ( think Orwell's 1984). #ipaavic .@lisadempster : But can literature also be an avenue for change? #ipaavic .@lisadempster : are there any novels that resonate with the experience of working in the Victorian public service? #ipaavic Haire: Elliot Perlman Three Dollars - the main character is a public servant working in the DPI #ipaavic Haire: it's a book about working behind the scenes in government and how it can lead to personal transformations #ipaavic Graeme Head has just admitted to not reading many Australian authors. Someone needs to send him an Aussie reading list ASAP #ipaavic Yates: Courtrooms provide a snapshot of what societies were thinking at the time. This is partly what makes Mockingbird so interesting Yates just drew a parallel between To Kill a Mockingbird and Australia's present treatment of asylum seekers Thorn: Wolf Hall tells a story of hope and reformation as the foundations for democracy are created by novel's end #ipaavic Katy Haire reads a passage from Hilary Mantle's Bring up the Bodies. There's a great love of literature in the room here #ipaavic Yates: the beauty of books is that they give you a sense of personality and character - they can bring historical figures to life #ipaavic Q for the panel: how do we foster literary writing in our day to day work in the public sector? Our language is often bureaucratic #ipaavic Head: often we use a certain language to avoid speaking clearly and plainly. We can learn from literature about how to communicate better Weasel words should be out. Powerful and passionate writing should be in, says Thorn. Panel: it's important to be genuine and authentic in your communication. Whether you're writing a novel, or policy brief! #ipaavic The drafting of treaties is an example where the subtly of language can be an agent of change, says Haire. Panel agrees about the power of words. Great communication, in literature or in life, can have transformational power #ipaavic That's the end of the session. What a great discussion! Thanks @lisadempster and panellists. #ipaavic We're taking a break now for lunch. See you again at 2pm for a discussion on crowd sourcing technology for public policy creation #ipaavic And we're back. The final session for the conference is on Digital Futures: crowd sourcing technology for public policy #ipaavic Panellists: David Bartlett, former Premier of Tasmania, and Bruce Muirhead, CEO and Founder of the Eidos Institute #ipaavic David Bartlett: policymakers shouldn't be intimidated by social media, because it brings opportunities if you look for them #ipaavic Bartlett: a ubiquitously-connected digitally-empowered community is smarter than a thousand, or a million, policy wonks #ipaavic Bartlett: Platforms like Facebook are terrifying for public policy experts, but it shouldn't be   #ipaavic Bartlett: we can use the creation and provision of online marketplace to our advantage #ipaavic Bartlett: we can participate in the online marketplace to engage with the community & generate new public policy ideas #ipaavic Bartlett: Bill Gates almost had it right: In today's digitally-empowered societies, Community--not content--is King. #ipaavic Bruce Muirhead: is crowd sourcing an anti-trend?

This question will be considered tonight #Button2014 Marr: there are many faces of Abbott - 'values' Abbott, 'politics' Abbott, 'intellectual' Abbott #Button2014 David Marr: the Prime Minister's notion of freedom is "interesting" #Button2014 David Marr: 'the Abbott that matters is politics Abbott' #Button2014 #button2014 Marr paints a conflicted Abbott: politics Abbott, values Abbott, economics Abbott not consistent Marr: We will get whichever Abbott that the situation demands. Because the Abbott that matters is 'politics Abbott' #Button2014 Marr: Freedom for Abbott is defined by instinct. You know it when you see it - you *feel* it #Button2014 Marr: Abbott's image of liberty is stern and virtuous #Button2014 Marr: I have not found a speech or praise from Abbott in favour of a universal declaration of human rights #Button2014 Marr: I don't recall a commitment to human rights being self evident during the Howard years #Button2014 David Marr: Let's not forget, in 2013, Labor made half-baked attempts to silence the press #Button2014 #auspol Marr reaches for a glass of water.

Do all people on the 'Left' think the same? #Button2014 Marr: When you talk about bias on the Left, prove it. When you talk about bias at the ABC, show me the evidence. #Button2014 Marr: the Abbott govt actually does not have a Freedpm Agenda. #Button2014 Marr: 'There's no Freedom Abbott. There is Politics Abbott. It's business as usual.' #button2014 .@so_s asks: Is Abbott sensitive to public criticism? #Button2014 Marr: I hear that Abbott is not particularly tough in face to face confrontation. He can be quite collegial, perhaps too much. #Button2014 Marr: Howard may be the most professional politician we'll see in our lifetime.

But it has reduced manufacturing cost to bring products to market #MSSIChina Garnaut: Developments in #China make it increasingly possible to reach the 2% climate goal agreed to in Copenhagen #MSSIChina Ross Garnaut now taking questions from the audience #MSSIChina Garnaut: Economic growth and improvement in environmental conditions are not mutually exclusive #MSSIChina Garnaut: Japan through the 70s & 80s illustrates how states can increase energy requirements without harm to the environment #MSSIChina Question from audience member about climate change at the G20. Garnaut: Climate change should be on the G20 agenda #MSSIChina Q: What are the uncertainties in China's energy transition. A: Garnaut - An inability to improve manufacturing processes & poor clean energy infrastructure could stall China's transition #MSSIChina Garnaut: China's use of gas has been relatively low. However, it is likely to increase when new pipelines are built #MSSIChina @MSSIMelb Garnaut: Australia stands alone in moving backwards on climate change, making its position rather idiosyncratic #MSSIChina And we're done.

Hugh White: We need not concern ourselves with China's future growth. What matters is the growth China has already achieved. Hugh White: China's strategic power is much greater than what the Soviets posed against the US during the Cold War. Hugh White: People often remark that China does not have any allies. This is true. But it does not mean that Chinese diplomacy is weak. Hugh White: I think #China has ambitions to seek primacy or leadership in #Asia.pic.twitter.com/P5OdRdX7K7 Hugh White: China's leadership in Asia might be like United States leadership in the West. And that's not necessarily a problem. Hugh White: It is incredible that China has shown such patience for so long before challenging US leadership in Asia. Hugh White: I think China believes that America believes that the US could not win a prolonged clash over a Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands dispute. And we're done.

From 2005-2013, Erika Feller held the post of Assistant High Commissioner (Protection) with the UNHCR (@refugees) Erika Feller will be talking tonight about international #refugee law, drawing on her personal experiences working with @Refugees Feller on implementation of int'l refugee law: The 1951 Refugee Convention is the cornerstone of #refugee law Feller: But the Refugee Convention is not perfect. Doesn't specify what burden sharing should mean in practice - one example of its flaws Feller: The Convention is still relevant but practical constraints will challenge the rule of the #Refugee Convention in some circumstances Feller: The implemtation of int'l law relies on 3 key tracks: legal clarity, political support and practicality Feller: Refugee law also goes beyond the Refugee Convention. Refugee law is now firmly locked into human rights law .@Progressive_Con That's an interesting point. Indeed, Erika is speaking about how the Convention though crucial is also imperfect Feller: Working in the field teaches you that the principles of the UNHCR have a very complex operational context Feller: Internal armed conflicts, rather than persecution, is now the primary driver of refugee movements Feller: Despite sophisticated asylum processes, there is a growing negativity about asylum seekers in Western countries Feller on #Syria: there are 3.2 million Syrian refugees, and if current trends continue, there could be another 1 million by year's end Feller on #Africa: continent still hosts the largest number of refugees and displaced persons in the world Feller: Making int'l refugee law relevant in today's complex #refugee problems is a challenge Feller on urban refugees: the urbanisation of the refugee problem is an increasing phenomenon Feller: More refugees choosing to fend for themselves in cities, rather than live in refugee camps. Refugees in #Egypt a good example Feller: Principles of refugee law must be in the service of better protection; better protection for refugees the utmost guiding priority Feller quotes #R2P founding father Gareth Evans: finding the necessary political will to act is the hardest challenge Feller: How to make the rule of int'l law real? Political will from states is key Feller concludes by reflecting on Australia: the Australian example supports the conclusion that the rule of law is still a work in progress #Budget2015 didn’t deliver the major reforms to the PBS that were expected.

A: @ALeighMP - We need to have more culturally-diverse members in politics. That would be progress. Final Q to @ALeighMP from audience: Why did you use the word luck and not chance?

Follow along with the hashtag #futuredemocracy  Glyn: What has Australia learnt from 2016's rise of populism? Andrea: 1 in 5 Australians moving their vote away from the old parties. #paulinehanson Andrea: #onenation had a bigger share of Australian vote in the 90s compared to their popularity today. #auspol Glyn: To Adrienne, how strong are constitutions in holding countries together through a rise of populism? Adrienne: 2016 was an attack on constitutionalism, not just democracy. Adrienne: These attacks include constitutionalism- Trump has a disregard for the media, disdain of facts Adrienne: Alexander Hamilton separated judiciary, executive and congressional powers in the constitution to avoid this rise of populism. Adrienne: In Australia, we have one of the strongest separation of powers from the judiciary in the world. Adrienne: Compulsory voting is likely to work against populism. Adrienne: Two risks, executive powers of party leaders and off shore actions such as refugee camps to escape legal scrutiny is concerning. Roberto: I was shocked but not surprised about #Brexit and #Trump Roberto: Democratic apathy and "sound bite politics" feeds disenchantment. #futuredemocracy Philomena: Long term trend which is anti-establishment- scary. Philomena: Just because French citizens voted for LePen does not mean they were all racist they felt disenfranchised about other issues too. Philomena: Since 80s there has been huge anti-globalisation sentiment which means huge anti-EU. Philo: In Hungary, Poland and elsewhere we are seeing a rise of anti-immigrant/woman/EU sentiment. Philo: Strong desire for a strong leader in these countries. Glyn: Is fake news brought on by the rise of social media? Or have we always had it? Andrea: Fake news has always been around in some form since 1922. Andrea: Its different now where technology allows for rapid dissemination of this fake news. Andrea: Cultural institutional power of the media is being challenged by key figures such as #Trump Adrienne: Solutions lie in our politics and civil society. Roberto: People are clearly disillusioned. Macron and Obama represent 'movement' politics which seems to resonate with people positively. Philo: There isn't a sense of "I trust my government because they'll do something good for me", more scepticism and dissatisfaction. Philo: Voters' needs aren't being satisfied, high unemployment and unprecedented numbers of refugees. Glyn: Why are leaders considered to be 'out of touch'? Andrea: Social media facilitates an echo-chamber effect. No cross-pollination of ideas. We need to read widely from a variety of sources. Adrienne: Australians are not interested in symbolic reform. We need concrete legal action from our politicians. Roberto: We are unaware of how out of touch we actually are. Roberto: A man who voted to leave EU said he did so because he "wanted for people to know that me and my family exist" Philo: Poor communication and consultation of what #Brexit meant for Britain. #futuredemocracy Questioner: What role does xenophobia have in recent geopolitical events? Philo: Populists appeal to this fear and sense of a threat that is posed to civil society. Fear of the unknown results of immigration. Questioner: Are we in control of our political destiny? Andrea: Populists' ability to control their message through social media enables an engagement with alienated people. Questioner: How well do constitutions protect against fascism? Adrienne: Constitutions are only as strong as the political leaders who execute them. Questioner: Should Macron be tweeting 'thank you' to Trump? How did Trump effect Macron's success? Roberto: Trump won't be remembered as a successful populist. Roberto: Trump still has a solid support base. The values he represents are still strong. Questioner: What does the phenomenon of Bernie Sanders represent among young people? A rise of left wing populism? Andrea: Pollies can sell hope or fear. Sanders sold hope. Trump sold fear. Questioner: How does climate change affect democracy? Andrea: Its become a political football eg. clean coal. An example of how political debates can be reframed for a political purpose. Andrea: Private enterprise, I predict, will find the solution. Questioner: What is the most practical antidote to fear? Philo: Policy is not enough. A sense of community is crucial to alleviate fear. A new narrative is needed for the EU sense of community. Philo: Turning away from the extremes is important. Don't legitimise them, reject them. Roberto: Sense of fear about climate change, immigration and war drives this desire to become isolationist. Adrienne: There are ways to tap into feelings of hope and a positive future to aspire to, Macron and Sanders represents this. Adrienne: While fear is present, hope still exists. Andrea: Canada represents a changed narrative that highlights hope. Same Sex Marriage in the West represents wide spread social progress. Andrea: We are more empowered than ever to call out institutions for misdemeanour using digital technologies in a positive way. Glyn: Citizen participation in democracy is needed and more and more sought for. Thanks everyone! What a fantastic conversation! Audio recording will be uploaded soon!

Vote on online poll ➡️  We'll be live tweeting from 6.15pm at 2017's John Keane Lecture on 'The New Global Disorder and the Rise of Despotism' Use #JohnKeane2017  For this live tweeting, we'll be using the following abbreviations. Prof John Keane= JK Glyn Davis= GD #JohnKeane2017 JK: Is the West stumbling its ways towards the future, defined by their incompetence? #JohnKeane2017 JK: Widening gaps between rich and poor, war, militarisation of police, species going extinct. Rot is spreading. JK: This anxiety dovetails with observations of a dark political trend. JK: New birth of despotism rising in Turkey, Russia, Iran, The Emirates, but what do they share in common? #JohnKeane2017. This new rise exists it what was once known as 'Eurasia' that carries the largest population in the world. #JohnKeane2017. Russia and China are developing a tense yet mutual relationship of support. #JohnKeane2017. Don't think of these despotisms as states, they are thickets of power. #JohnKeane2017. These new versions of despotism are not authoritarians, however. They have democratic qualities. #JohnKeane2017. Despotism learn how to govern and win the loyalty of the population. #JohnKeane2017. There are moments of craziness among these despotisms. Bizarre things happen. #JohnKeane2017. Despotism now mixes with democratic practices. Mindful of the need to gain popular support. #JohnKeane2017. They know that force is unsustainable. Institutions are only durable if they have the support of the people. #JohnKeane2017. New despot regimes encourage people to be passive, and be concerned with their own lives. #JohnKeane2017 Book- "China in Ten Words": People are ubiquitous and yet somehow invisible. #JohnKeane2017 Everyone is implicated in corruption in this despotic environment. They are regimes of connection. #JohnKeane2017. These despotisms are plutocratic. New species of capitalism. #JohnKeane2017 "Let some of them get rich, first" #JohnKeane2017 Significant gap between rich and poor, driven by the desire for material gain. #JohnKeane2017 Loyalty to the regime remains in tact despite the increasing wealth and poverty of different parts of society. #JohnKeane2017 These regimes are held together by polysemic governments. Lots of talk of the people, and of democracy within these regimes. #JohnKeane2017 "The Kremlin's idea is to control all forms of discourse". Able to discuss human rights and at the same time act differently. #JohnKeane2017 Growing ability to be a government for everybody. #JohnKeane2017 All of these despotisms have a middle class. Often quite sizeable. #JohnKeane2017 What does the middle class think about these regimes? In China, they are opposed to state intervention. Not in favour of free and fair elections. Do middle classes stabilise these despots? Psephocracy- everyone of these despotisms practice free and fair elections at some level of the polity. 
#JohnKeane2017 More than 1 million elections have been held in China since the 1980s #JohnKeane2017 Among these, they electoral integrity is quite high. Elections allows disputes to surface, and rotation of leadership at the highest level. Provides sources of new blood. #JohnKeane2017 Puts opposition in a quandary so these despots can rule absolutely. #JohnKeane2017 Media Cultivation of Appearences: These regimes are media saturated. #JohnKeane2017 Dependent on a network. #JohnKeane2017 People of these despotisms can decode propaganda. #JohnKeane2017 Those who rule, understand well that its important to be seen as approachable. #JohnKeane2017 These despots hide in plain sight by using orchestrated media. Efficiency of Violence: Often police states. Violence is used to oppress its opponents. #JohnKeane2017 Camouflaging of violence. Local level of violence done by state sponsored thugs. Important to keep the population on side. Violence is the way to unpick that, hence the need to camouflage it. #JohnKeane2017 Rule by Law: Much of the power that is exercised in these despotisms, is in the name of protecting the law. #JohnKeane2017 Despotism, alerts us to the problem of voluntary servitude #JohnKeane2017 How is it that top-down power, can win the loyalty of the people? #JohnKeane2017 Are sanctions the best way to address these despots? #JohnKeane2017 A new cold war? #JohnKeane2017 What is to be done with the rise of China and other dispotisms? Trade embargos, investment sanctions? #JohnKeane2017 Just as elements of democracy exist in these despotisms, aspects of despotism exists in our Western democracies. #JohnKeane2017 Might it be, that these despotisms are our future? #JohnKeane2017 A QandA will now take place. GD: Most of history has lived in non-democracies. Does that mean democracy is a passing moment? JK: Democracies can be asphyxiated by a different form of power that has democratic qualities. JK: The marketization of everything in a neo-liberal model, there are many losers as George Orwell predicted. JK: Hungary could be an allegory of our times. JK: Hungary now has lost its, independent judiciary, media, and yet has elements of neo-liberalism. JK: Trump's powers enable him to dismantle independent institutions like the FBI. A Second Trump Presidency? #JohnKeane2017 JK: Maybe the way forward is to treat the devils within our own democracies. Questioner: Supranational entities have a lot to do with running the world. What are your thoughts along those lines? #JohnKeane2017 Questioner: Are we scared to let go of liberalism?  #JohnKeane2017 JK: Despotism escapes this conventional idea of sovereign power. JK: Complete neo-liberalism could risk large corporations behaving despotically. #JohnKeane2017 JK: Institutions within these despotisms that are secretive, publicly unaccountable,  who's collapse could be damaging. Eg. Chinese banks. While most despot politics are topdown, the centralised leadership problems are its greatest weakness. #JohnKeane2017 Questioner: How does despotism translate to regional governance? #JohnKeane2017 Questioner: How do we spread awareness about this? #JohnKeane2017 Be aware of the idea that the political class often seems to be complacent which causes disaffection among young people. #JohnKeane2017 JK: Address this high level of distrust of our policy makers. #JohnKeane2017 Some of these despotisms have many faces, which effects decentralised regional power #JohnKeane2017 Through the regions, they can affect the rule of law. Despotism is pervasive and as seen in eurasia, is spreading. #JohnKeane2017 Thanks everyone! What a fabulous discussion!! Hope to see you soon! Be sure to follow @EUC_UoM and @jkeaneSDN!! We are live from @EUC_UoM 'Rethinking Governance" @AndrewWalterUM is currently presenting on banking crises AW= Are populist party's success stemming from banking crises? Why do some governments survive these crises? Such as Merkel? Much has changed over the last 150 years. More bailouts=more expensive More bailouts in democracies since the 1970s Greater expectations re protection of income à la Keynesian theory Unprecedented demand for income and employment stability AKA embedded liberalism/ wealth repression What is driving gov bailout increases is middle class concern about wealth protection. Pressure from below the polity. Middle class wealth increases boomed from late 70s Resulting in growing middle class bailout constituency Democratisation should prevent increases gov bailouts Also results in declining probability of Government survival Failure to protect wealth=voters will punish Poses dilemmas for govs. Bailouts politically costly but difficult to avoid 81 banking crises over last 150 years AKA 19.3% govs experience banking crises Governments dominated by single parties loss 2-3% of the vote who don't experience banking crises Shifting perception of banking crises before 1949 However after 1970s, banking crises present a challenge to Gov's survival Governments in 70s lose 10% voter support during banking crises US/Canadian banking crises in 1907 where gov do nothing for wealth protection, both govs maintain power in spite of mass fin collapse Implications- long run societal expectations over gov now matter More middle class pressure= high risk bailout behaviour Financialisation raises political cost of bailouts should they fail We shall be back at 1pm with @PooleAvery on "South East Asian Democracy in Decline?", Join us then! 😁😁 August 3, we'll be hosting a discussion w/ the author behind the book @SenWarren says "Every American should read"  We're back again for another compelling session, this time by our Assistant Director Dr Avery Poole. Stay tuned!  #RegGov17 @PooleAvery How do political leaders among ASEAN states talk about democracy considering the political diversity within SE Asia? #RegGov17 @PooleAvery As opposed to the EU, the ASEAN states do not have to be democratic. There is no Copenhagen Criteria. #RegGov17 @PooleAvery Little  evidence of what democracy means in the context of ASEAN. There will be a diverse understanding among SE Asia #RegGov17 @PooleAvery Indonesia largest leader in ASEAN, most democratic. #RegGov17 @PooleAvery Indonesia in early 2000s worked to show that state religion and state democracy were not incompatible #RegGov17 @PooleAvery Democratisation is sometimes destabilising.  Phillipines has recently experienced a challenge to its liberal democracy. War on Drugs raises particular concerns. Duterte often employs democratic rhetoric to legitimise his actions in the name of security, safety and independence. In Thailand, democratisation has brought about significant challenges. #RegGov17 @PooleAvery What does this mean for ASEAN? Optimism about democratisation, but some regimes disappointed democratic expectations. #RegGov17 @PooleAvery Are leaders of states may be more likeley to challenge the constraints of democratic rule? #RegGov17 @PooleAvery We need to problematise this regional norm of democratisation #RegGov17 @PooleAvery Political diversity in the ASEAN region needs to be examined in the domestic political context of each member state. #RegGov17 @PooleAvery @GillianTriggs will join our @Pathways_UoM fellows tonight, reflecting on her career as President of the @AusHumanRights.

 Modern societies are rapidly changing in response to a plethora of dynamic and complex forces and policymaking has to adjust.  Simultaneously trust in expert knowledge appears to be diminishing #crisisofexpertise What knowledge counts? Whose knowledge is more influential? What knowledge enhances social progress and cohesion?  What expertise will enhance policymaking?  Government_UoM is examining these questions now. #crisisofexpertise We're here at @unimelb Arts West for #CrisisOfExpertise conference.  James Parker @MelbLawSchool welcomes @SJasanoff, @Kennedy_School Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies, to deliver keynote address. #CrisisOfExpertise  Keynote speaker @SJasanoff examines: how does cognitive bias influence post-truth society? #CrisisOfExpertise  Jasanoff: what parts of the problem do we attribute to structure (things that can't be changed) and what do we attribute to agency? #CrisisOfExpertise Jasanoff: trust in science and trust in democracy rest on the same bedrock. #CrisisOfExpertise Audience question: increasing specialisation is a feature of modernity – so how do we 'bridge' knowledges? Jasanoff: just because knowledge areas are specialised, doesn't mean we can't open the 'black boxes' around them and share.  #CrisisOfExpertise Contested knowledge: truth, trust and expertise with Darin Durant @unimelb, @Colwight and @HelenCSullivan #crisisofexpertise  @colwight discussing "Post-Truth, politics, and dealing with uncertainty" at #crisisofexpertise  "Facts are paradigm dependent.

What was a stand out point for you? Closing reflections and future research prospects with Shiela Jasanoff @SJasanoff, Andy Stirling, Matthew Kearnes @mbkearnes in conversation with Jeremy Baskin @Government_UoM #crisisofexpertise  We are kicking off @Pathways_UoM for 2018 at the iconic @ACCA_melbourne . Looking forward to hearing @latingle and seeing all our wonderful alumni!  @cazzmelbourne welcoming @latingle and announcing applications for @Pathways_UoM will open on March 8 on #IWD2018  @latingle Discussing if feminism is a political movement and whether it’s been a success “Not a conventional political movement, but it is successful because it has changed and evolved over many years.” @cazzmelbourne “Lack of trust is a huge issue in politics. How do you see this lack of trust playing out in the next few years?” @latingle “It’s a global issue.” @latingle “It’s a core issue that drives politics in Australia. We get bogged down in it, Barnaby Joyce being the latest example.” Tingle: “I think we have to work out what federal and state governments do, it remains the case the transfer of issues between the different levels occur in a very haphazard and curious way.” Schwartz: “Do you think Australian politicians are equipped to deal with this split between left and right?” Tingle: It stems from growing inequality. It’s sort of a chicken and egg type question- which came first. Tingle: My sense is that political self interest will bring this division back to balance over the next few years. Schwartz: How would have the Barnaby Joyce saga played out if he was a woman? Tingle: To me the story was about Barnaby had an affair with this woman who fell pregnant which was hugely problematic. Affairs in Canberra happen all the time. A lot of questions surround how he asked his staff to protect him. That’s what the story is about. Tingle: there’s a physical photo of the evidence of their affair because this woman is visibly pregnant. It’s an example of how powerful images can be. Question from the audience: How should we hold politicians to account? Tingle: We have to address the real issues. The capacity for people to identify the issue and go for it, is much greater than it has been in the past. Recent campaigns by GetUp is a great examples, so is the #MeToo movement. Schwartz: The women’s marches in the US have been hugely successful at giving a voice to this movement. Question from the audience: Do you think we will have an election this year? Tingle: I don’t think there will be an election this year. Question from the audience: How do we shift public opinion to supporting good policy rather than popular policy? Tingle: A lot of it comes from good advocacy and strong political communication skills. We have lost confidence and trust in politicians when they sell a “good policy”. Schwartz: How long until we have another female prime minister? Tingle: it won’t be all that long. It just requires the right person to come along in the right circumstance. I can’t see it happening in the next two or three years. But it will happen. What can we learn from HIV policy teach us about managing future pandemics?

Join us today 1-2pm @MelbLawSchool room 221 for a brownbag seminar 'Legalisation, Diplomacy and Development: Do investment treaties de-politicise investment disputes?' with A/Prof Lauge Poulsen &amp; convenor Dr Jarrod Hepburn. Register:  Follow this feed to stay up to date  with our first #publicpolicylecture with Sharon Lewin talking about #HIV research and future #pandemics.@unimelb @uommedia  @HowitzerJ welcoming Sharon Lewin #HIV #policy  #thegrimreaper ad campaign reached 90% of households in 3 weeks after its release in the 80's.  37 million are living with HIV today. 30% of them don't know their status.  Over 50% of people who have HIV globally are women, but in Australia the majority is still gay men. If any country can do it, Australia is best positioned to reduce the rate of new HIV cases. The next step is advancing HIV science to creating a vaccination. Treatment got people out of their death beds when they came into prominence in the 90's. For peoople living with HIV today who take the appropriate treatment, their life expectancy is normal. Over half of people who are living with HIV today are able to access treatment. Policy adjustments that have built two tier pricing systems have allowed poor countries to access antiretroviral therapy. This new policy has saved millions of lives. While we do have effective treatment to prevent AIDS, there are increases in AIDS related deaths in parts of Asia and Europe. @UNAIDS has set targets for all countries called 90, 90, 90. 
90% aware of their HIV status
90% on Treatment
90% virally suppressed Biggest advance in biomedical science related to HIV is PReP. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. But few countries are willing to pay for PREP. Australia only recently agreed to subsidize it. Dramatic advances in HIV are not the science alone. The policy has really made the difference. Australia was the first country to allow access to clean needles. Which is why today we have no new cases of HIV among those who inject drugs. HIV in indigenous is increasing. New cases are five times higher compared to non-indigenous Australians. Many laws criminalising HIV are from a bygone era. Policy needs to keep up with the science. There's a whole lot of policy work around countering other pandemics once PREP is accessible condom use historically goes down. PEPFAR a US policy initiative by George Bush is the largest investment in fighting any infectious disease in the world. $US6 billion every year. Will we see the end of #HIV ? Few infectious diseases have been eliminated. They can only truly be managed. Treatment and cures aren't as simple as they seem. HIV gets into our DNA, that's why it's so difficult to overcome. Global funding for research is dominated by the US policy initiatives Only 1 case of someone being cured from HIV completely. What about future pandemics? There are increasing numbers of new diseases because of all kinds of factors including microbial resistance, climate change and increasing ability for people to travel around the world more regularly. Emerging global alliances against new diseases are becoming more sophisticated and better organised to deal with pandemics. Fear stemming from a lack of awareness still affects stigma and progress. Will Sunday's #SAvotes election continue a downward trend in the two major parties’ primary vote throughout Australia?
