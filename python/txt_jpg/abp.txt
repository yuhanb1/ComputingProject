The dropoff of women starts at around age 30 - Ingrid Bakker @HASSELL_Studio It's not a pipeline issue, we need lots of solutions to solve a loy of problems. Gender equity is not a singular issue - Justine Clark from @_Parlour There are some positive signs, more women are likely to run their practices than ever before You can't just want gender equity to happen, you have to do something about it - Justine Clarke @_Parlour The whole profession at large is missing out when we exclude people who are no longer registered or practicing - @CameronBruhn from @ArchitectureAU Nicole Kalms from @monashada began XYX labs to apply design principles to research social issues In interviewing young women in Melbourne, they became the experts on their own experience and helped researchers identify hotspots on where they experienced harrassment Similar maps have now been developed in Sydney, Lima and other cities around the world! The Free2Be Project is a proactive approach to design spaces for young women so that they feel safe without having to stand in a yellow box and a red button to push - Nicole Kalms @monashada Justine Clarke @_Parlour led the way on ensuring team lists are recorded to ensure architectural histories are correct. Architecture shouldn't and isn't singular in nature @OpenHouseMelb In order to attract females to participate in architecture and design, the projects and research have to be of interest and be led by them - Nicole Kalms @monashada Young women are leading the way in making projects more equitable. They know that enough is enough. Ingrid Bakker - @HASSELL_Studio Does architecture need to have a #MeToo moment? When I became a mum, it was assumed that I would stop working. That is when I decided it wasn't the right firm for me - Ingrid Bakker @HASSELL_Studio There also needs to be a conversation in the industry about flexible working hours for all parents, not only mothers. I'm fortunate that HASSELL is leading by example - Ingrid Bakker @HASSELL_Studio To celebrate the upcoming exhibition PERFECTION to be held in the MSD's Dulux Gallery, Science Gallery is hosting this free screening of Ex Machina tonight  How Boyd are you?

It nurtures eccentricity, combining robust heritage with a kind of restlessness, which I love.  AB: I‚Äôve learned so much from London - it was one of the first examples of a city embracing mass urban housing &amp; also minimalism  AB: you need to insist on these qualities as an intrinsic part of your work - in architecture, beauty was not always permitted - we need to reclaim beauty as an intrinsic part of architecture  AB: Salt House was a way to explore hybrids, geometry &amp; the organic relationship between interior &amp; exterior  AB: Housing design is the social project of architecture @AlisonBrooksArc  AB: Housing is the way we as architects can most directly impact people‚Äôs daily quality of life @AlisonBrooksArc  AB: Bath Western Riverside project was a regenerative scheme. I took this project as an opportunity to reinterpret the Bath crescent originally created by 18th century developers.  AB: The Adaptable Tower - Greenwich peninsula is an opportunity to
draw on the spirit of its Victorian infrastuctural, industrial past - with this project it was important to me that it didn‚Äôt necessarily appear to be residential architecture - it‚Äôs adaptable over time.  AB: Cohen Quadrangle. A lot of my ideals as an architect aligned with the college - that is it is a pedagogical model. We were renewing the collegiate ideal - People live, eat, study, learn, work all in the one space. @AlisonBrooksArc  AB: Using Stainless steel shingles on the Cohen Quadrangle celebrated the craft of building and drew on the history of the original Oxford architecture - the overall idea was to create a journey from the historic to the modern  The @AlisonBrooksArc ideals moving forward  Congrats to @unimelb Architecture student Djuro Djuranovic, who spoke to SBS about the Global Architecture Profiling exhibition on the contemporary architecture of Belgrade, Serbia opening tonight at 6pm at @msdsocial.

Brenner suggests the 'urban population threshold' needs to be reconsidered in the present day #urbanization Brenner argues that there are serious empirical problems with the proposition that >50% of the world's population now lives in cities. "China is 24%, 31 % or 73% urban in 1999 depending on which of three urban designations are used"  @UrbanTheoryLab #urbanization Brenner suggests we need to reclassify the criteria for 'urban' vs 'rural' by looking at the way we measure #urbanization Supposedly rural realms are being radically transformed by #urbanization -@urbantheorylab maps this process Neil Brenner discusses some of the theoretical problems with the dominant discourse on the #urbanage.pic.twitter.com/6xKj9VtxkP Neil Brenner on #batman and his frustrations with urban spatial theory.pic.twitter.com/h9N3q1ku6I @UrbanTheoryLab looks at the areas on a global map which are supposedly non-related to #urbanization - this forms the exhibit @msdsocial Neil Brenner now 'rapid firing through a bunch of stuff' on urbanization. The problems are not with the maps, but the methods behind the maps #urbanization #urbantheory "There is no 'outside' to the urban condition" - Brenner @UrbanTheoryLab #urbanization Neil Brenner says the @UrbanTheoryLab wants to supersede the notion of the  urban / non-urban divide. Zones of resource extraction become part of the urban fabric in these new cartographies - Brenner #urbanizationpic.twitter.com/dkwwW096MV Siberia, the Amazon, Pacific Ocean and more no longer seen as 'empty' in @UrbanTheoryLab cartographies of #urbanization @msdsocial Great to host Prof Brenner for our first DLS tonight, & just a reminder that his @UrbanTheoryLab #urbanization exhibit is now on @msdsocial Reminder: fresh, local foodie goodness every Wednesday from 11am in union square @unimelb @MelbFarmersMkts @VEILmelb Call for (1min) architectural films.

Hope to have it fixed today or tomorrow. We will be live tweeting MSD Presents: Jean Nouvel from 7pm. Join us! @ateliersjnouvel #pritzker #architecture #jeannouvel And so we begin. A packed house! #JeanNouvel #MSD  Art, cinema, photography, philosophy intimately connected with architecture in 1968 Paris #JeanNouvel #MSD Architecture is philosophical enquiry #JeanNouvel #MSD Architects must experience poetry, imagery and aesthetics to shape their spirit #JeanNouvel #MSD Architects must have a poetic vision for the way we will live in the future. Forego the rational #JeanNouvel #MSD Architects struggle against bureaucracy, right-wing ideas that crush quality of life #JeanNouvel #MSD The architect is the interpreter of society #JeanNouvel #MSD Passionate conversation between Jean Nouvel, our Dean Daryl Le Grew and journalist Andrew McKenzie  Architects must also be fighters, to resist, to make no assumptions about their power (or perceived lack) #JeanNouvel #MSD The modern passion for demolition left us without the foundation for our ideas #JeanNouvel #MSD I now feel very strongly about the history of our urban geographies #JeanNouvel #MSD If a city is degraded it's soul is degraded. We must design for its soul #JeanNouvel #MSD History breaks up urban monotony #JeanNouvel #MSD The homogeneous effect of globalisation must be taught against through valuing history #JeanNouvel #MSD Australian cities have a sense of agency in their architecture #JeanNouvel #MSD Architects must see problems with and around projects with open eyes. Don't turn a blind eye #JeanNouvel #MSD I will defend the hard work and long hours of architects until the very end #JeanNouvel #MSD Too often projects start with a box and then trap a talented architect inside #JeanNouvel #MSD Buildings end up looking like bourgeois hotels when their purpose couldn't be more different #JeanNouvel #MSD Interiors and exteriors must be of the same allegory; play the same music #JeanNouvel #MSD To create a building is to make a movie, we design to selectively frame our landscape, create mystery through aesthetics #JeanNouvel #MSD Artists must positively interfere with our cities and play at the scale architects do #JeanNouvel #MSD Students must move beyond facade design, it is without responsibility #JeanNouvel #MSD Students must seek responsibility in their work and, later, professional practice #JeanNouvel #MSD Manifestos are useful for creating focus and precision in your work #JeanNouvel #MSD Architects can collaborate and network with NGOs to speak more loudly, collectively #JeanNouvel #MSD Every building should be an adaptation to its space, and, therefore, be idiosyncratic with its own system of style #JeanNouvel #MSD Young architects must accept their career will be ever-challenging #JeanNouvel #MSD And that's a wrap. Thank you @ateliersjnouvel for a poetic insight into your thinking. Check our YouTube for the film of tonight's event. "Young architects must accept their career will be ever-challenging."

Follow our live tweets #landscapearchitecture  PEG landscape + architecture are one of the most innovative firms in the world #landscapearchitecture Karen will be talking about patterns, digital technology and sustainability in the design of our landscapes #landscapearchitecture The split between science and aesthetics in #landscapearchitecture are being impacted by the digital McHarg and Walker's layering methods, fitness vs flatness. PEG patterns focus on sustainability #landscapearchitecture New media enables pattern finding and pattern forming #landscapearchitecture Digital media are only recently being deployed for pattern + form, the formal, not just the temporal #landscapearchitecture Patterns can be used to build back site functions especially in post-industrial contexts #landscapearchitecture Lafayette Park project: use of geometric patterning, fabrication of tiles that support drought-resistant planting #landscapearchitecture Not Gardens: exploring customisation of inexpensive materials to create patterned landscapes on vacant land #landscape architecture Playing off traditional "Knot" gardens, laser cut templates for plot designs #landscape architecture Very quick installation, two days. Designing landscapes with low expertise requirements - democratic, inclusive #landscape architecture Patterns forming via the interaction of elements can be used in construction: PEG's work with storm water management uses flow patterns PEG designed + fabricated custom geo-cells for storm water infiltration trenches #landscapearchitecture Showing flow, not just stopping at function #landscapearchitecture  PEG's work in Taiwan is very focused on climate change-driven periods of drought #landscapearchitecture PEG designing for drought AND deluge #landscapearchitecture  PEG build digital models to simulate behaviours in our landscapes, showing water, growth of plants #landscapearchitecture Simulations don't determine form; they inform how you can intervene #landscapearchitecture Designing with nature: patterns resonate within science and the aesthetic #landscapearchitecture PEG constantly test their designs. Their work is a continuing experiment. This expresses contemporary #landscapearchitecture And that's a wrap.

A big welcome from our Dean Daryl Le Grew to Judith Innes who is presenting Planning in Complexity tonight  @UCBerkeley 's Judith Innes on wicked problems, increasingly complex world means more complex issues for planners  DIAD theory of collaberative rationality can be applied to resolve wicked problems All collaberation is not innately equal, how can we make it fair? Diversity, interdependance and authentic dialogue is key Authentic stakeholder dialogue must be legitimate, accurate, comprehensible and sincere Identify the institutional void, pull together all stakeholders and different agendas to start the learning process  Collaberative small working groups of key players can focus on a breakdown of specific tasks to help tackle the larger problem at hand 1990s CALFED formed with no formal legislative backing to navigate California droughts and manage state water flow Bypassing institutional bureaucracy &amp; collaberating informally based on trust, communication and overarching goals can mean faster progress Informal collaberations can lead to lasting commitees, networks, research opportunities and the basis for formal long term policy change Thank you Prof Innes, your overarching message is loud and clear @UCBerkeley #collaberation #planning  @gemcarey @The_PolicyShop @UCBerkeley Judith Innes's lecture is now available:  Watch: latest Dean's Lecture by Judith Innes of @UCBerkeley on applying collaborative rationality to wicked problems  Watch: celebrated architects Bijoy Jain and Donald Bates in conversation at MSD  Alan March at the 1st of 3 seminars on planners' role in shaping resilient spaces #resilientbuiltenv @pia_planning  The difference between resistance and resilience is significant #resilientbuiltenv #planning @pia_planning  Want to study with us?

Follow our live tweeting of Wolfgang Kessling of @TRANScloud #thermaldesign  Kessling: how do you build a cloud that can sit on stage during a play for over an hour? #thermal design  Kessling: to build a cloud, you need stage design + cool air + climate engineering - technology and techniques #thermaldesign Kessling: Stage lighting helped contain the cloud, but candle light onstage burnt holes in the cloud, so delicate #thermal design Kessling: Fun climate engineering is designing the process of building a cloud and giving it to a theatre in Munich #thermaldesign Kessling: 60% of new built environment to 2030 will happen in Asia #thermaldesign Kessling: Most future built environment development will happen in hot, humid climates #thermaldesign Kessling: The way we define comfort has occurred to a 22 degree Celsius standard #thermal design Kessling: Buildings in the tropics designed for adaptive comfort consume 50% less energy #thermal design Kessling: Shell and core concept of climate control involves designing climate control for core use areas #thermaldesign Kessling: Facades should be built to provide full autonomy of daylight AND artificial light (energy capture) #thermaldesign Kessling: Climate engineers working in design teams can achieve thermal comfort quite simply #thermaldesign Kessling: what street dimensions and street orientations work best to prevent heat island effects? #thermaldesign Kessling: green corridors through cities support the circulation of cool air, if this air hits the CBD at a 45 degree angle #thermaldesign Kessling: How do you design a greenhouse in the tropics? Floor cooling + low-e coating inside buildings + roof glazing #thermaldesign Kessling: Singaporean greenhouse project created a 'cool' Mediterranean climate #thermaldesign Kessling: Singaporean greenhouse: a forest mountain + waterfalls which create clouds and fog, cooling the internal climate #thermaldesign Kessling: projects like the Singapore greenhouse must inform broader energy efficiency solutions #thermaldesign Kessling: The way we design for comfort must impact how we design our buildings; design for air movement not air con #thermaldesign Kessling: Humans don't mind how their comfort is created. Low energy solutions + tempered air systems work #thermaldesign Kessling: if we can design for thermal comfort indoors, can we also create it outdoors? #thermaldesign Kessling: Team Breathe Austria created cool crisp Austrian air in Milan #thermaldesign Kessling: If you can bring temperatures down by 6 degrees, you have brought it down by one whole comfort range #thermaldesign Kessling: Architectural and Climate Engineering Commandments #thermaldesign  Kessling: we know we need to reduce emissions and we know we need to be part of the solution now #thermaldesign Thank you Dr Kessling and @TRANScloud for an inspiring lecture #thermaldesign #lowenergydesign  MSD's Kim Dovey on #urbanisation  Researchers from our Thrive Research Hub in this behind the scenes look at planning to rebuild a Nepalese school  Apply now: we are looking for sessional tutors for 2017 to deliver undergraduate and postgraduate teaching  Next week: Second talk in our series about urban planning and resilience with @pia_planning  MSD‚Äôs Tanja Beer on using design as a tool to connect kids to nature @TheLivingStage #runningwild #thelivingstage  Celebrating design from Australia &amp; China at the Sino-Australian Dialogue    Exhibition opening at MSD  Welcome @njuniversity 's Lu Andong, here to open Sino-Australian Dialogue on Design Practice Research exhibition  Congrats to Mark Burry, Gini Lee and Stanislav Roudavski, whose research has been funded by the @arc_gov_au  Design for education is strong at MSD and in the Melbourne design community.

 Our third and final talk on resilience in the built environment begins!  #resilientbuiltenv  Janet Stanley brings the "social" into the social resilience framework. #resilientbuiltenv  Janet: Studies have found about 1/4 of people lack the resources to be resilient if it is needed #resilientbuiltenv Janet: When a group of society are disadvantaged, the whole of society is disadvantaged.  #resilientbuiltenv  How it is all connected.  #resilientbuiltenv  Janet advocates for the 20 minute neighbourhood, and quality neighbourhoods, to greatly assist social resilience  #resilientbuiltenv  Children also need opportunities for self-actualisation for social resilience #resilientbuiltenv  We're excited for Stephen, a regulations guy. Regulation is super exciting.  #resilientbuiltenv  Stephen: Our current regulatory systems are not equipped currently to respond to the challenges we are facing.  #resilientbuiltenv  Planners put in planning scheme that they will "plan" to mitigate coastal inundation (example). Who will do the planning? #resilientbuiltenv  Spatially resolves ideas of what you plan to do. Clear aims. We need to be clear WHAT the response is. Not to "respond" #resilientbuiltenv  Wendy Steele highlighting our  already clear and present challenge. It's proliferation is vast, its scale is huge. #resilientbuiltenv  Wendy: Planning has barely engaged with the challenge at all. We are still responding in a very 20thC way  #resilientbuiltenv Wendy: The invisibility of most of our real infrastructure is usually only "seen" with disaster. #resilientbuiltenv Wendy: The "internet of things" goes far beyond ICT and energy. It is our whole society. Health, homes, society... #resilientbuiltenv We don't have the tools to analyze huge real time data of whole pop.s. We haven't engaged with what the "smart city" is. #resilientbuiltenv  Wendy: Technology is bursting through and within us, and we're acting like it isn't happening. #resilientbuiltenv Simon Wollan: We experience a continual of change. How do we adapt without losing our continuum? #resilientbuiltenv  Simon: These are the three keys of resilience. #resilientbuiltenv  How do we knit together the various characteristics of a resilient community.  #resilientbuiltenv  Simon: Resilience is about continual change, and openness as well as local.  #resilientbuiltenv  Anna Hurlimann talking about how planning DOES have the capacity to plan for resilience.  #resilientbuiltenv  Is urban resilience building capacity and/or planning for adaptation? #resilientbuiltenv  Anna: We have many tools but we are usually only looking at one at a time. #resilientbuiltenv  We're starting to see things such as Overlays used to manage risk. But it isn't implemented consistently. #resilientbuiltenv  It's also about spatial fairness, temporal fairness and procedural fairness.  #resilientbuiltenv  Anna: Planners need to develop conviction, and plan proactively.  #resilientbuiltenv  Discussion with our excellent panel #resilientbuiltenv  Rachel Carey from @VEILmelb about to be interviewed on Parallel Lines about Melbourne's foodbowl - tune in!

Planned de-industrialisation. #JLCohen  In the 60's, Paris embarked on the most ambitious housing program in Western Europe, mostly using pre-fabrication #JLCohen In the 60's the state intended to inject funding into new suburbs and neglect the current city  In the 80's President Mitterand funded points of cultural significance such as a refurbished Louvre rather than restructuring Paris #jlcohen #JLCohen highlights the imbalance between East and West Paris: income, social services and transport all higher in West Sarkozy's strategy of starchitects to redesign places for office buildings + quality housing (not social housing) was derailed #JLCohen New strategy involved architects working with social scientists to plan and design strategies, NOT grand buildings #JLCohen #architalks @KimEncel Thanks for coming along @KimEncel, hope you're finding it as interesting as we are! #JLCohen showcasing the breadth of ideas presented in 2008 on how Paris could be: a city to the sea, a porous city, a metropolis ring etc... Instead of ten people designing Paris, there were 10 x 25 architects, urban planners, anthropologists, economists etc. - a new way #JLCohen There is still no unified regional plan but there is some municipal co-operation on ideas presented in 2008 have been implemented #JLCohen Paris has responded to becoming a "museum" city for tourists by commissioning 21 projects to revitalising various public terrains #JLCohen #JLCohen: There is a new trend which I call "Buildings with salad"  #JLCohen: Macron will eventually face the problems inherited from his predecessor, but seems to understand the importance of city planning. Thank you to the 100s of people who came along tonight and for joining the fascinating and insightful talk on Paris by #JLCohen #architalks @GabLLB We're all french history, architecture and contemporary anthropology experts now!

A type of code for their work #MinsukCho #architalks  The social life of high rise buildings is key to their design in Seoul #MinsukCho #architalks  Designing for university campuses is designing for a civilising influence on society #MinsukCho #architalks  Korea is 70% mountains - it's own national design challenge #MinsukCho The research an architect needs to do to design for people is almost anthropology #MinsukCho Mass Studies designs explore the lost architecture of the ceiling, the dome, seen in trad Korean architecture #MinsukCho  Designing for tech companies, Medieval approaches are better than the Silicon Valley fondness for warehouse-like structures #MinsukCho  Pavilions are instant monuments to collective intimacy #MinsukCho #architalks  There is a democracy to pavilions because they are initially intended for the street #MinsukCho A forest-like pavilion constructed in three days for #Obama inauguration #MinsukCho  Mass Studies' Korean Pavilion is the project that never ends: a heartfelt desire to tell the story of divided Korean Peninsula, #MinsukCho  The DMZ is a haven for endangered species and biodiversity; could host a seed bank: inspiration for Mass Studies #MinsukCho Existing tunnels along the Korean border could be ideal for a seed bank #MinsukCho Hoping that the seed bank idea finds a design collaboration between Nth + Sth #MinsukCho  Thank you to #MinsukCho and Mass Studies for a wide-ranging lecture on the social good of architecture.

R+U: competition work has helped enhance our speculative &amp; theoretical approach to design  R+U: material honesty of modernism is no longer adequate to give presence to a place  R+U: O-14 building combined conventional planning &amp; a theoretically more free way of using the space within we aspired to balance both the simple &amp; the highly patterned to create the exo-skeleton envelope  R+U: Taipei Music Centre gives identity to the local pop music scene in Taiwan &amp; attract tourism  The project started as both an architectural &amp; planning project; a multi-functional public precinct, not just a building R+U: Taipei's elevated walkways fed into the music centre project proposal, seperate but connected, inside &amp; outside  R+U: like 0 14, we wanted the Pop Music building to resonate with its surroundings, including natural surroundings  R+U: Kaohsiung Port Terminal project combines recreational, service, industry &amp; transportational function in 1 site  R+U: industrial background of the Port was evident early on, given the high amounts of oil in the earth, requiring 2 yr cleanup R+U: Uni of applied Arts Vienna let us rethink both older urbanism &amp; the newer informal dimension of the school  R+U: education &amp; learning meets public space in the Vienna project; tradition meets innovation  R+U: we are not working in a vacuum; each project engages &amp; interacts with many influencers R+U: connecting public space with work space is paramount.

Three key messages for tackling climate change adaptation with #ChristineWamsler  "Development work is circular, not linear. Mainstreaming climate adaptation is crucial as poor planning is an increasing factor in risk"  Although climate adaptation is widely advocated to foster resilience, it has not been implemented systematically. #ChristineWamsler Adaptation mainstreaming needs 5 measures to reduce risk: avoid hazard exposure reduce hazard exposure, reduce vulnerability of the area... prepare for an effective response to a hazard impact and prepare for effective recovery from hazard impacts #ChristineWamsler #ChristineWamsler showcasing how hazard exposure can be avoided in practice of climate adaptation  Reducing vulnerability can be done through physical measures but also soft measures such as advocacy and campaigns  The most typical form of recovery for hazard impacts and disasters is insurance #ChristineWamsler It is important to address all 5 levels of risk because local resilience depends on the inclusiveness and flexibility of a combined set... rather than relying on the effectiveness of one measure. #ChristineWamsler Design measures will address physical, environmental, social and economic aspects of risk through combined set is crucial in adaptation Six mainstreaming strategies which address local, institutional and larger systemic levels #ChristineWamsler  Only Christine could relate cinnamon buns with climate change adaptation and mainstreaming! #ChristineWamsler  The city depends on citizens' support #ChristineWamsler  Citizen involvement in the process of developing urban resilience is often absent. @cityofmelbourne is a rare exception! #ChristineWamsler #ChristineWamsler concludes by summarising her adaptation framework for a more resilient, sustainable and inclusive future.  Cinnamon buns, climate change adaptation and greater citizen involvement. Thanks #ChristineWamsler for the sweet, insightful lecture! More live tweeting tonight at MSD!

We're about to welcome guest speaker #JeffHou, join the convo üëã  Check out Jeff's extensive publications:  Articulating a different take on many Asian urban hierarchies #JeffHou  Contemporary Asian cities are cities of multiplicities. Shanghai the playground of starchitects #JeffHou Along with remarkable cityscapes, there are remarkable landscape projects, city mayors vying for the best #JeffHou Then there are ordinary citizens living in ordinary cityscapes, with their own orders, hierarchies with their own forms of vitality #JeffHou Ordinary people form their own version of cities not shaped by designers #JeffHou  Hong Kong: resistance to commercial interests exists #JeffHou  How do you prevent the loss of everyday cultural landmarks? How can architecture engage more deeply with citizen cultures? #JeffHou Treasure Hill, Taipei: informal settlement transformed into sustainable urban community; preservation is possible  In Treasure Hill artists photographed residents, becoming the free local photography service in the process #JeffHou  Upgrades to Treasure Hill preserved the functional use of the settlement by residents; disruption minimised #JeffHou Treasure Hill offers pointers to new design practice for redeveloping urban areas that still house long-term residents #JeffHou Open Green Taipei brought together urban planners and landscape architects to activate urban space #JeffHou  Local groups demonstrating rainwater harvesting at Open Green Taipei #JeffHou  Urban regeneration as distinct from slash and burn renewal processes - taking their lead from the existing buildings and people #JeffHou Urban renewal stopping waste by offering tool libraries, maker spaces, people can fix their own possessions #JeffHou  Urban regeneration must create social spaces both outside and indoors, bringing people together in many contexts #JeffHou The basement of the Nanjichang Residences in Taipei transformed by young activists into a community-run marketplace  Tokyo: in expensive Ginza private space is given for free to volunteer bee keepers #JeffHou  Tokyo: Curry Caravan is a placemaking project feeding people to create greater social cohesion  Food, planting, gardening provide simple ways for neighbours, communities to spend time together. Role for landscape architects #JeffHou Community garden projects like Edible Way are becoming more and more recognised as examples of good design #JeffHou  Bohemian youth transforming space in order to socialise #JeffHou  The urban conditions of Asian cities require multifaceted approaches; designers need to extend beyond their current practice #JeffHou Messy urbanism implies plurality; resistance to stale citymaking; opportunity for a new collaborations that encourage justice #JeffHou Young landscape architects now join #JeffHou - Jackie Gou, Jenny Yu, Jessica Lee, Eileen Jung  Panel: informal settlements actually very important to cities, create community #JeffHou Panel: landscape architects need to coordinate top-down design with bottom-up change #JeffHou Panel: what is the role of the landscape architect? To design, yes; but there is so much more we should do for people #JeffHou Panel: as cities become more and more duplicated, landscape architects must design for multiplicity of real people's needs #JeffHou Panel: creating frameworks for local people to decide how space should be used #JeffHou Panel: high density populations of Asian cities amplify issues - that's where Jeff's analysis is useful for other continents #JeffHou Panel: there is power in gentle and flexible ways of creating change #JeffHou Panel: placemaking a hot trend right now in landscape architecture, but too often just an exercise in branding #JeffHou Panel: bottom-up placemaking initiatives are often more successful, more likely to last #JeffHou Panel: placemaking projects that are community driven can take a long time, that needs to be acknowledged and supported #JeffHou Placemaking must unpack design and planning, offer open processes to people who don't think of themselves as designers #JeffHou Good placemaking projects do a form of matchmaking: funders to volunteers, designers, residents, artists, activists #JeffHou A global movement, people are frustrated by institutionalised design and planning processes that can't respond to ordinary people #JeffHou Small placemaking projects create 'cracks' in a city that open up flows of change #JeffHou Tactical urbanism is sometimes used by design firms to market their services first and foremost, lacks subversive spirit #JeffHou And that's a wrap on an inspiring lecture, thanks to Jeff Hou and our panel üå±üåºüåàüèô  @JF_Kuhlmann The panellists were analysing purpose of interventions - if they're just about branding they're not about creating greater social cohesion A mid-20th century system is not going to deliver for a mid-21st century environment - planning an autonomous future  WATCH: Dean's Lecture guest Prof Christine Wamsler on how to increase our urban resilience  Student work from our Design for Ageing studio is featuring at the @AlzheimersAus National #Dementia Conference #BeTheChange2017  Student work featuring at the @DementiaAus Conference looks at design principles for dementia &amp; minimising stress on people as they age.  @ArchiFlix is hosting lunchtime screenings of their top films at MSD's Dulux Gallery next week, Oct 23 - Oct 27.
