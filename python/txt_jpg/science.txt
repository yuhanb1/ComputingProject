Great idea @MelbIntGen...get involved.  @karinv Unless the meeting involves drinking beer and eating burgers, followed by a game of footy and dinner...then it is unacceptable! This week's @SciMelb @MelbIntGen seminar: Colin Semple  Vote 1 @mixOmics_team @MelbIntGen @unimelb  Here, here @nikolabowden focus should always be on quality...not quantity! Encourage your students/post docs to work smarter, more effectively and have some life balance! #worktolive not #livetowork  Great resource for postdocs  I like it @ScienceChiefAu #sciencerocks #ScienceMatters  Yes!!!!

Enjoy @GenomeConf and safe travels back to @MelbIntGen  Pumped for the #ConverSciCRISPR lecture @ConverSci @unimelb @SciMelb - massive crowd #sciencematters  Brilliant basic science - CRISPR technology changed the future of gene therapy overnight - intro to #ConverSciCRISPR @ConverSci with @doudna_lab &amp; @kesvelt presenting Transparency of how science is done - focus on the ethics #ConverSciCRISPR In 2012 in the @doudna_lab - CRISPR was born #ConverSciCRISPR To read, write and re-write the code of life is now possible with CRISPR #ConverSciCRISPR @doudna_lab Curiosity based science is the original of most amazing findings, technologies, therapies, etc. #basicscience #ConverSciCRISPR Convergence is a buzz word in Science #ConverSciCRISPR @ConverSci Precision gene editing is now possible with CRISPR - powerful basic science #ConverSciCRISPR This lecture will not be long enough...I could listen to this stuff all day #ConverSciCRISPR @SciMelb  Ok here comes the ethics and scary bits @ConverSci Human genome editing: science, ethics and governance...important to discuss these bigger questions @ConverSci #ConverSciCRISPR @kesvelt sculpting evolution lab @MIT 'gene drives' to control pest or invasive species #ConverSciCRISPR Cool comic @kesvelt...but has a serious connotation and consequence #ConverSciCRISPR  Homing based gene drive system is extremely powerful but needs to be regulated, controlled and directed...one example where it is applicable and appropriate is Malaria #ConverSciCRISPR Very engaging!  Rules of engagement - engineering complex systems @ConverSci @kesvelt  The power to intervene = moral obligation with gene drives, genome editing and CRISPR #ConverSciCRISPR Should all gene drive experiments be pre-registered?? #ConverSciCRISPR - interesting question indeed Yes  Why don't scientists share what they are doing from the get-go? #ConverSciCRISPR #scicomm Lessons...but are they lessons learnt? Open science is faster, more efficient and safer...we need to share our data...science is everywhere and not 'ours' but belongs to society #ConverSciCRISPR - IP could be the key Thought provoking stuff @ConverSci ✔ #ConverSciCRISPR Public debate is essential in Science #scicomm beyond translation #ConverSciCRISPR Today we have both @rafalab and @MarylynRitchie speaking in our @SciMelb @MelbIntGen seminar series starting from 10:30am in FW Jones Theatre, Medical Building, @unimelb. Come along for this amazing double header featuring two world-leading researchers!  @SciMelb @unimelb Welcome future scientific leaders! @SciMelb @unimelb - a world of opportunity in Science awaits @rafalab is up first...unexpected results in genomics...should be interesting  @MarylynRitchie starting her @MelbIntGen seminar with a Cluedo reference...nice  Tell me more @SciMelb ... can @MelbIntGen help at all?  Absolute pleasure to have @MarylynRitchie here @MelbIntGen @SciMelb @unimelb. Very thought provoking issues in your talk yesterday.
