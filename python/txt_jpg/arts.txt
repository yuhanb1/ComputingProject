 @nikki_moodie @unimelbsoc Welcome aboard @nikki_moodie! Look forward to seeing your adventures with us üòä @unimelb You can find out more about Ian McLean's research into Australian art and its history at his @unimelb lecture on June 6. Spots still available!  We're live-tweeting @BostonGlobe's Pulitzer Prize-winning Editor-at-Large, Walter Robinson's sold-out lecture on the power of investigative journalism to #KeepDemocracyAlive at @unimelb tonight. 

Stay tuned from 6.30pm!  We're about to get started with the @unimelb AN Smith Lecture feat. @WalterVRobinson on the role of investigative journalism against the excesses of power! Join the conversation tonight #KeepDemocracyAlive  Full house tonight at the @unimelb AN Smith Lecture in Journalism! #KeepDemocracyAlive  Thanks @GlynDavisVC for introducing @WalterVRobinson to @unimelb! Also thanks to @journalism_melb, @USSC and @DartCenter for making this visit possible. #KeepDemocracyAlive  Democracy works well for everyone only when journalism works well for everyone #KeepDemocracyAlive  "In both cases (the Catholic Church and Trump), the world would know very little, or perhaps nothing at all, had it not been for the stubborn persistence of investigative reporters determined to get at the truth." @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive Every time I think my sense of outrage has been exhausted, the Church graciously does something to do it @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive Who could possibly have imagined that men who worked in the lord's very shadow would cast countless children into a hell on earth from which many never escape? @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive To get to our very first story in 2002, we chipped away for five months as an impenetrable granite wall. But as often happens to reporters, we stumbled upon the cover-up quite by accident. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive To me, what was most striking was that nowhere in 10,000 pages could we find a single expression of concern or remorse for one of the children who wandered into Geoghan's grasp. #KeepDemocracyAlive One million words. Not even one for any child. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive In the end, we learned that nearly 250 priests in Boston had abused children. That's 10.7% of all priests who served over a sixty year period. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive If you find a diocese that reports a percentage of abusers that is under 8 percent, you have found a diocese where the cover-up likely continues @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive Before 2002, you have to remember, the only thing that spread like wildfire was a wildfire. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive The internet's impact on journalism inhibits the very reporting that helps cleanse democracy, that makes it possible for citizens to make informed decisions in our democracy, that insures that powerful institutions are held accountable. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive In the late 1990's, there were 25,000 reporters working for American daily newspapers. Nearly half of those jobs have gone. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive Often I'm asked if the Globe would undertake such an investigation today. The easy answer is yes, of course. But the honest answer is that no paper can investigate wrongdoing it has not a clue about. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive When you no longer cover city hall, a decision many newspaper have made, then the whistleblower has no one to call. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive Corruption unnoticed is corruption unchecked. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive Many editors decided investigative reporting was a luxury they could no longer afford. But in fact, the past 18 months have made so clear that investigative reporting is a necessity we cannot afford to do without. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive When I covered the White House, reporters were invited to the press room in the West Wing every often for a Q&amp;A session with someone who could be identified only as a "senior government official". #KeepDemocracyAlive Last week, when President Trump cancelled his June 12 with North Korea. Not wanting anyone to think the effort was totally lost, the President said he hoped that a June 12 summit was still possible. #KeepDemocracyAlive But what Trump had to say was swiftly contradicted by a report in the @nytimes, quoting an unnamed senior White House official as saying there was no chance the June 12th could still be held. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive The effort to marginalise and delegitimise journalists is a major imperative of this White House. Muzzling the press is critical to Trump's power to have his way. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive It is the role of the press to protect the public from the excesses of government. It is not the role of the government to protect the public from the supposed excesses of the press. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive In the digital age, it is a wonder they have survived this long. In the US, newspaper advertising and circulation have cratered. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive Ad revenue fell from $65 billion to $19 billion between 2000 and 2016. The same free fall is occurring in Canada and the UK. I doubt that Australian newspapers are immune from these trends. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive Yes I believe in a future for investigative reporting. It will survive. It may even prosper. It will matter. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive But I wonder. Will it do any good? Can good journalism breathe fresh life into a calcifying democracy? @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive I find it unimaginable that good journalism will vanish not because some cartoonish tyrant banned it, but because people are indifferent and don't care enough to support it. That we cannot permit to happen. @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive On shielding himself in reporting on sensitive issues, @WalterVRobinson says he didn't do a good enough job for himself. #KeepDemocracyAlive Where does @WalterVRobinson read news? The @NYtimes, the @BostonGlobe and the @Guardian! #KeepDemocracyAlive On his hopes for the future: "Information in a free society is such a valuable commodity, I believe that someone in the generation of new students will find a way to viably monetise it. And so I have hope." @WalterVRobinson #KeepDemocracyAlive Thanks for joining us at an incredibly insightful, memorable and important @unimelb AN Smith Lecture in Journalism presented by @WalterVRobinson on the role of investigative journalism against the excesses of power. #KeepDemocracyAlive  @hypothejess Thanks @hypothejess for coming along! Yes the recording will be made available. We'll share it around. Hope you enjoyed the lecture tonight! - Thomas from @ArtsUnimelb ‚ò∫Ô∏è @benbirchall We think this takes out selfie of the night!

 We are getting ready for our public seminar about China starting at noon in Nth Lect Theatre Old Arts. Prof Gareth Evans welcomes our special guests from Remin University, China. From cringeworthy to cool, @unimelb anthropologist @Cynthia_Sear says the novelty of Australiana is bringing a new wave of fashion to our iconography
 Professor Shi spoke about China's future as a world power and its relationship with the USA. First issue being discussed by the panel is the USA's military presence in the region and how that affects China's 'space'. Professor Shi says the Chinese Government does not want to spend too much money on national defence. The panel is discussing China's relationships with countries in South East Asia. One of our students asks if China should form a European-Union style relationship with other countries in Asia. Prof Evans asks our guests to talk about criticism China has received regarding North Korea. Now the topic is China's responses to the recent actions of leaders in Libya and Syria. Professor Shi says a prime minister who can speak fluent Mandarin is not necessarily exceptionally good at dealing with China. @DrJaySong @abcnews @bevvo14 .ping @unimelb @uommedia! @unimelb Thanks to the incredible Laura McKellar @__okay for the beautiful illustration of the Arts West building! üòäüëè You can now drop into the Visitor Centre at Gate 10 Parkville and find @ArtsUnimelb notebooks for sale, featuring an illustration by Laura McKellar @__okay of the @unimelb Arts West building! üòÆüòÆüòÆ  Two decades after the fall of Suharto, is Indonesia finally taking its human rights record seriously?

Register now:  Privileged to have @msdsocial‚Äôs Prof Philip Goad to present tonight‚Äôs @unimelb NGV Masterclass, as part of the MoMA: 130 years of Modern and Contemporary Art exhibition at @NGVMelbourne  Tonight he is presenting on the untold stories of artists from the Bauhaus movement who emigrated to Australia after World War II Georg Teltscher was deported from London on the infamous Dunera, he taught in Sydney before returning to the UK and changed his name to George Adams. His full set of postcards are on display at @NGVMelbourne!  Pictured is the Six Pence Note, scribbled around the edge are the words: we are here because we are here because we are here Ludwig Hirschfeld-Mack was also deported to Australia on Dunera, where he moved from Hay to Orange to Tatura. He was to teach art and Bauhaus principles at Geelong Grammar until his retirement in 1957.  He had a lasting and profound influence on education and art in Victoria and Australia - one of his works inspired Roy Grounds as he designed the Arts Centre and @NGVMelbourne! Gertrude Seligmann-Herzer fled Germany in the 1937 to Sydney with her 10 year old daughter. She would teach Bauhaus principles and design jewellery for decades.  Her life was not easy, nor particularly happy. She would become frustrated with authorities as she struggled to reclaim objects from family in Germany. Never financially stable or widely celebrated, her story of emigration was ultimately one of racism and of loneliness On the other hand of the spectrum is architect Harry Seidler, whose Bauhaus influence experienced profound success after a difficult childhood  His works and focus on materiality and form, created significant connections and had a major influence on Australian modernism. Thank you @unimelb‚Äôs Philip Goad for sharing your fascinating insights on four influential Bauhaus figures who have shaped Australia @msdsocial #NGVMasterclass  Privileged now to have Prof Maria Gough, the¬†Joseph Pulitzer, Jr. Professor of Modern Art at @Harvard to speak about art, modernism and the machine to conclude tonight's @unimelb #NGVMasterclass!

 Thrilled to have Managing Director of @GuardianAus, Dan Stinton and Director of @journalism_melb Andrew Dodd in conversation with Will Slauter @w758 at @unimelb about the #FutureOfNews in the internet age üòØüòØüòØ #HistoryOfNews  ‚ÄúNews has become personal, and has been driven by the rise of social media. News has become the news feed.‚Äù @GuardianAus Managing Director, Dan Stinton on what news has become #FutureOfNews @unimelb  How does social media affect traffic and is there additional pressure for journalists? For @GuardianAus, only 9% of traffic comes via social, but for other news outlets it can be over 40%. It depends on the outlet - Dan Stinton What stories are being missed due to the monetisation of journalism? 

A growing phenomena called ‚Äúnews deserts‚Äù, where traditional media have not been replaced adequately by new media, so local issues are no longer being covered. #FutureOfNews @journalism_melb Andrew Dodd One person in WA controls the most popular TV stations, newspapers and websites which can reach 92% of Western Australians. This is the #FutureOfNews if the consolidation of media continues. - @journalism_melb Director Andrew Dodd Good news is expensive and hard to do. The skills of journalists are still very important to society. @GuardianAus @journalism_melb #FutureOfNews  What is the future of @abcnews? It is almost untouchable to the lives of Australian people. It is here to stay but it will be battered and beaten. But it is a fight that needs to be fought because it is precious. - @journalism_melb Andrew Dodd  There have been 3,000 redundancies in journalism roles since 2012. But there are more jobs which require the skills of journalism than ever #FutureOfNews - @journalism_melb Andrew Dodd  We have deprived ourselves of pluralism in the media, and echo chambers have grown as a result. #FutureOfNews @journalism_melb @unimelb - Andrew Dodd Our audience under 28 are consuming far more of our news via audio and podcasting platforms than text and apps - @GuardianAus Dan Stinton #FutureOfNews Visual literacy is equally as important as the ability to read. Fake news is spread frequently by inaccurate images and inaccurate interpretations. #FutureOfNews - Will Slauter @w738 Why is satire becoming a key source of news? @UnaMcIlvenna #FutureOfNews

There is a deep demand for it. They speak truth to power which cuts through to us. - @journalism_melb Andrew Dodd Thanks @GuardianAus Managing Director Dan Stinton, Director of @journalism_melb Andrew Dodd and to #HistoryOfNews course leader Will Slauter @w758 for a fascinating discussion of the #FutureOfNews today at @unimelb! üëèüëèüëè  We are seeing a modern incarnation of Australian Nazism, says @unimelb historian Jordana Silverstein @jewonthis.

 Adele Ferguson on how we came to the need for a banking royal commission: 'A combination of factors led to this disgraceful mess. Conflicted structures, targets and bonuses that fuelled greed and created a toxic culture that put profit before people' 'But there was something else, a regulator that neglected to do its job.' 'Under-resourced, too soft, too trusting, too afraid to use the full force of their powers, too collaborative, too chummy, too captured sums up the problem' 'The media reporting exposed serious shortcomings in the regulator' 'So why is it that independent journalism stepped up while regulation failed? The answer to that question is simple. It‚Äôs independence. My colleagues and I dedicate our careers to developing the skills necessary to see through the PR spin, vested interests &amp; regulatory capture' 'It‚Äôs why the fourth estate is so important. It is to give a voice to the powerless in society and expose wrongdoing' - @adele_ferguson 'Independent media isn‚Äôt there to make life easier for the wrongdoers. It is there to call a spade a spade and print the truth' 'ASIC could have named and shamed these institutions but it chose not to. This is something independent media will always do. Something I would always do if I have the proof' Adele Ferguson @adele_ferguson 'If there had been more accountability and public shaming by the regulator, things might not have deteriorated to the point they did. Brave whistleblowers going to the media is the reason we are finally getting some change.' 'While we can all take comfort that the media has acted like a quasi-regulator with far less resources, there are looming challenges' '...They include draconian defamation laws, outdated suppression laws and feeble whistleblower protections' 'Whistleblowers are vital to a functioning democracy. They put everything on the line to expose wrongdoing' @adele_ferguson 'There is the other well-documented issue challenging public interest journalism, the rise of global media social platforms...which has eaten the advertising revenue, once the lifeblood of traditional media outlets' 'In Australia, thousands of journalists have been let go as a consequence of the challenging business models. With less money, quality journalism is harder to do.' 'But it isn‚Äôt all doom and gloom. The media is finding new and innovative ways to do its job' 'In the last few years media groups and journalists here and overseas are working together to break big stories. The Panama Papers showed how journalists from around the world can collaborate' 'Journalism has been the catalyst for the banking royal commission, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in 2013...' '...the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory and the Royal Commission into Age Care Quality and Safety' 'That‚Äôs the role a free press plays in society. It shines a torch on wrongdoing, exposes misconduct and holds those in power to account. It‚Äôs what makes our democracy better' 'I‚Äôd like touch on another important area in which we can strengthen journalism. 

We need to teach young people the vital role that media plays in democracy' We've come to the end of this year's AN Smith Lecture in Journalism!

 We're live from our 'Criminology: Behind the headlines event'! If you couldn't make it but are interested in a career in criminology, make sure you follow our live updates and join in the conversation at #behindtheheadlines  We‚Äôre beginning tonight with a panel discussion. Our host Prof. Nesam McMillan is joined by Prof Russell Smith, Fiona Dowsley @FionaDowsley, Dr Dave McDonald @drdavemcdonald, Dr Bianca Fileborn @snappyalligator and Dr Claire Spivakovsky @ClaireSpiv Our panel will tackle three important societal issues - drugs, disability and criminalisation, and victims issues as well as explore the career opportunities available to Master of Criminology graduates #behindtheheadlines Dr Dave Mcdonald @drdavemcdonald begins on the topic of 'victims': 'It‚Äôs fair to say that over the last few decades the significance of victim‚Äôs rights has become an increasing area of concern" Dr Bianca Fileborn @snappyalligator explores whether the criminal justice system 'addresses what victims believe justice to be' and 'what else might we do to create a sense of justice' for victims Fiona Dowsley @FionaDowsley notes that the idea of offender and victim is very singular 'there can be an overlap between victims and defenders..there‚Äôs a proportion of people that appear on both sides of that story' Our panel has moved onto the topic of gender-based violence, and particularly the impact of the #MeToo movement #behindtheheadlines "What we saw‚Ä¶was women sharing experiences that are often dismissed as ‚Äòtrivial‚Äô" - Dr Bianca Fileborn @snappyalligator Dr Bianca Fileborn @snappyalligator also comments on the potential for social media to become a counter-cultural space and place for survivors to share their experience Fiona Dowsley @FionaDowsley says that @CrimeStatsVic has seen an "Increase in reporting since Me Too has kicked off‚Ä¶we‚Äôre also getting people reporting earlier" Our panel has now moved onto the final topic - 'Disability and criminalisation' #behindtheheadlines Dr Claire Spivakovsky @ClaireSpiv notes that "we are needing to understand the kind of assumptions that we as a society have about people with disability...and how they [these assumptions] are embedded within our law" Our academics will now discuss the opportunities available through a Master of Criminology üôåüôå Just a few of those being highlighted are the specialist subjects and internships available, the ability to undertake intensive subjects overseas and the opportunity to meet practitioners and grow a professional network Our attendees have now moved onto a practical exercise answering: "How do you maintain a good working relationship with the police whilst also holding them accountable?"

What do you think? ü§îü§î

#behindtheheadlines Some solutions from our #criminology students: 
-Broader community empowerment
-Import best-practice accountability mechanisms from around the world
-Creative, non-legal ways to ensure accountability, such as people's tribunals 
#behindtheheadlines Fiona Dowsley @FionaDowsley the Chief Statistician at @CrimeStatsVic is now discussing the value of criminology graduates in the workplace "they have an ability to think about multiple things at once" "It's a very practical discipline, more than some other humanities can be" #behindtheheadlines Dr Russell Smith - Principal Criminologist at the Australian Institute of Criminology, says that criminologists can work anywhere from mining companies looking at the theft of diamonds to the Great Barrier Reef examining environmental crime Government departments, research institutes, universities, law enforcement and working on policy are just a few of the common employers that Dr Russell Smith highlights @marcialangton @FionaDowsley Hi Marcia, it was just one of the skills that Fiona highlighted...unfortunately we weren't quick enough to grab them all :) And that's all from our 'Criminology: Behind the headlines' event!

Free entry, of course. bit.ly/nxdF8b Thank you everybody who has submitted questions. The panel starts in 20 minutes. We've delayed the start just a little due to #occupymelbourne extending travel time through the city. We'll be starting soon. Tonight's conveynor Helen Sullivan blames the delayed start on the 'outbreak of democracy' in the city. But we're underway. Our panel is @timwilsoncomau @adambandt @margaretsimons Dr Miragliotta and Dr Brenton. We start with a web question regarding the Queen's itinerary not including visits to Indigenous communities. Simons believes it reflects what the govt wants to draw attention to during the Queen's visit. Brenton wants to be controversial. He asks, why do we often show the nice parts of Indigenous culture and not the realities? As a British citizen recently arrived, Sullivan believes the Queen's visit is an ideal opportunity to draw focus to Indigenous communities. The panel is now discussing policies relating to vulnerable people. Bandt points out that if Melbourne had gone to Labor refugees would now be being sent to Malaysia. Simons believes Australia as a whole favours onshore processing, but a few marginal seats are preventing it from happening. Wilson believes the private sector is doing OK and the increase of the tax-free threshold will be a disaster. Brenton strongly disagrees. Brenton asks Bandt why he didn't drive a harder bargain on refugees. Says Greens will always choose a tree over a person. Bandt says Greens couldn't get better deal for refugees because Greens and Labor have different positions and are not in coalition. #auspol Miragliotta says the slowing down of govt due to more people involved in policy development can be a positive. Now to the audience questions. Why is the Australian media so uncomfortable with the idea of minority government? Bandt says the fact minority govt is new is one reason. The media's love for conflict is another. Bandt says Abbott has some 'accomplices' in the media. Wilson says 'constant bungles' by the government throughout their term is not helping the quality of media. Brenton says refugees were also politicised in a majority government. Next question is about the 'decline of policy'. Bandt believes Australians are asking why is politics no longer about the clash of ideas? Bandt says in the past the Treasury has refused to cost their policies. Wilson says public policy is about politics which is about values. Question from the audience: why don't they ask open ended questions during opinion polls? Simons says knowing what the public wants to hear about could help journalists set the agenda during election campaigns. Now something you don't see on QandA - Sullivan has asked the audience to make a comment. The panel is now responding to the comment regarding corporate influence on policy development. Brenton says the public is being consulted about policy, but the cross-section is too small. Miragliotta says Labor should not change leader and should do very little so they become a smaller target. @johnavarghese I hope you've enjoyed the panel! And the night comes to a close... well if you were here you could join us for drinks in the Old Arts building. #ff our guests @adambandt @timwilsoncomau @margaretsimons The event was hosted by @CPPunimelb This Wednesday a guest panel will discuss who can welcome asylum seekers to Indigenous land. http://bit.ly/pkiQKE¬† Watch our students, staff and graduates talk about the Melbourne Bachelor of Arts: In this short video our stude... http://bit.ly/qrS6WY¬† @shompie What degree is it? @shompie Thanks.

We were thinking about the aftermath of a bushfire, the process of death and re growth. Connor reminded us of this process. Meaghan: In our minds Joshua Connor always had to be @russellcrowe, we had a pic of him on a board whilst we were writing #waterdiviner Joshua Connor needed to be a bit rough and tumble. He isn't instantly likeable. Hard hitting questions from our alumni crowd are rolling in!pic.twitter.com/TBB4zOvP5B Q. What was the reception of the film like in Turkey? 
Andrew: overwhelmingly positive. Andrew: there were lines around the block in Turkey to see the film in opening week. Meaghan: the Turkish audiences thought the 'stereotypical' Turkish moments like the coffee ground readings were quite funny Andrew: the Greeks don't come out of the film looking fantastic but this was true of both sides. We didn't set out to demonise anyone Q. How did Andrew Knight get involved?
Andrew: I pitched him the story...he said it was a truly terrible pitch but a great story Andrew: Andrew and I sat next to each other, took turns typing out the story for weeks, asking Meaghan for help when we got stuck. Meaghan: Russell wasn't keen to play a bad guy, a lot of the rougher edges of his character are softer in the film than the book Q. What is it like to write a book with your partner? 
Andrew: no comment... Andrew: I strongly advise you to keep the novelisation rights to any script you are writing I case you want to expand your story Andrew: in exasperation Meaghan wrote 10,000 words of the book and said, now your turn. The couple wrote the book #WaterDiviner in only 7 WEEKS!!! Yelling story ideas to each other across their house. And one final question: what did you learn in doing the film? What's next? Meaghan: the process of film making, the editing, the casting...it was an extraordinary experience of fantastic chaos! Meaghan is also in the process of writing 2x books... And teaching in the Master of Arts and Cultural Management !

Hope everyone is staying cool!pic.twitter.com/eWEOXL671P @TransitionsFest chilly pig! We'll be Tweeting updates during our panel discussion tonight. You can send a question for the panel to @gshss even if you can't attend. Congratulations to everyone who received their VTAC offers today! About to start our discussion about International Responses to Democratisation in the Arab World. Looking forward to hearing audience q's! Guests tonight are G Evans, H Charlesworth, D Flitton, S Toman and T Lynch. Moderator R Eckerlsey. Eckerlsey says a youthful population is leading a wave of democratisation across Africa and Middle East. That's why we're here tonight. Evans says international intervention in #libya prevented a massacre. @gshss Q from Isabelle via web. What role does US have in fuelling govts which are now being rejected? Evans and Lynch are discussing the comparisons between intervening in #libya and #iraq. Some opposing views. Flitton discussing Australia's involvement in setting up a no-fly zone in #libya and the division between @JuliaGillard and Rudd. Totman believes many rebel leaders in #libya have defected from the military and hope to one day rule in a similar way to Gaddafi. Charlesworth believes women had great influence in #egypt revolution but is concerned they will not maintain that influence in new govt. Flitton believes traditional media was required to give context to social media during revolutions. Flitton said taking news from Twitter is like trying to drink from a fire hydrant. Evans believes problem with #syria is that neighbours will not support military action in the same way the neighbours of #libya did. Question to panel received from the web. What happens if these countries reject democracy? Lynch believes intervention by US in #Libya continues the trajectory of  long-running US foreign policy stretching back to Suez Canal. Totman says democracy is a grass-root movement and needs to come from the people and not be imposed. The UN became indispensable before it became effective - Charlesworth.

Higgins @PresidentIRL was the first in his family to attend university, and first to present lectures on sociology in Ireland Michael D. Higgins @PresidentIRL championed the reinvigoration of the Irish TV and film industries Professor Michael D. Higgins @PresidentIRL is an outspoken advocate on human rights for equal pay and rights for people w/ disabilities The @PresidentIRL Michael D. Higgins has been conferred the @unimelb honrary degree of Doctor of Laws after an introduction by @GlynDavisVC  Prof Michael D Higgins begins by connecting @unimelb with the strands of Catholic Irish influence after the Gold Rush  William Hearn (one of four foundation @unimelb prof) was Irish scholar of political economy + jurisprudence and considered 1st Aus economist Fyi, @PresidentIRL is presenting on "The Economic Debate - Australian/Irish Dimensions" Economists when confronted by the inapplicability of existing theory, demand that social reality change to reflect theory @PresidentIRL Anglican Archbishop Dublin Richard Whately was particularly interested in setting up new colony in South Aus Despite rejection, Torrens championed Irish migration to South Australia, or, as he later termed it, the ‚ÄòNew Hibernia‚Äô. Robert Torrens gave the impetus for the development of the principle of title by registration, developed Torrens system of land registration Context of Torrens system extension to Ireland 1891 was response to struggle for Irish tenant farmers, eventually resolved in UK Parliament A terrible tragedy, an irony of history as same legal technology was used at first to dispossess the first occupants here @PresidentIRL In Young Ireland, central assumption of property's sanctity represented a radical, agrarian path to Irish independence @PresidentIRL New Irish spirit in Aus ‚Äòopened up continents for the sons and daughters of Ireland (1/2)... ...far away from the grasp of the rack-renting landlord, the griping agent, and the selfish middleman‚Äô @PresidentIRL (2/2) There is something important in the distance b/w Aus and EU, between new and old which allows for independence of thought @PresidentIRL Rejection of Ricardian political economy came rejection of the formulation of theories of distribution, production, consumption and exchange William Hearn‚Äôs work Plutology. published here in Melb inspired what has been named the 'marginalist' revolution in #economics @PresidentIRL The marginalist revolution replaced objective theory of value with subjective theory where value is placed on goods by individuals' needs Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen considered significant scholars by @PresidentIRL for research undermining fundamental economic assumptions President Michael Higgins @PresidentIRL now turns his speech towards neo-liberalism. Is he for or against? Culture + economics should not be envisioned as antagonistic, not as a clash of the collective impulse with the individual impulse... ... but rather that economics should be considered as a cultural discourse in its origins and in its application @PresidentIRL Professor Michael D Higgins @PresidentIRL challenges economics with three difficult questions Can we integrate and facilitate new perspectives, or recover old ones, in the contemporary period? Is the economics which is being taught at third level sufficient to the present moment? Have we replaced questions of methodology with a restrictive focus on measurement? Can we lift economics out of the narrow ideological framework in which it is presented in these times? @PresidentIRL Can we even ask questions at all? @PresidentIRL says today's divisive ideological tensions border on anti-intellectualism "The rhetoric of neoliberalism remains even more pervasive as its policy prescriptions." @PresidentIRL "There is a glimmer of hope in that international institutions such as IMF are questioning once sacrosanct policy positions" @PresidentIRL "In this century fiscal and economic literacy may be as important to cohesion, citizenship and democracy itself." @PresidentIRL Thank you @PresidentIRL for the important call to social justice.

 The Iran impasse. Read an opinion piece by Assoc Prof Shahram Akbarzadeh of the Asia Institute on the ABC website:... http://bit.ly/bdAP2P Surprise! We‚Äôre covering an event: ACCA In Conversation with Cordelia Fine hosted by Carole Schwartz @cazzmelbourne. They‚Äôll be covering the #UnfinishedBusiness of feminism and equality in the 21st century. We‚Äôll be live tweeting from 6.30! @ACCA_melbourne  Carol Schwartz starts by giving a shoutout to @The_PolicyShop on the episode on quotas featuring Ross Garnaut. Do they really work?
 Cordelia Fine‚Äôs book ‚ÄúTesterone Rex‚Äù challenges the norm by saying the genetic differences between men and women are based from outdated beliefs in many academic disciplines #UnfinishedBusiness @ACCA_melbourne  Anecdotes do not make data - Cordelia Fine in response to @cazzmelbourne‚Äôs question on whether boys and girls toys make a difference The studies which show that men are more risk-taking than women fail to account the domain and context within the questions are asked.

The differences between men and women disappear when you ask objective questions and objective situations. #UnfinishedBusiness Characterising women as tempering the excitement of men rather than as bold leaders in their own right impedes progress - Cordelia Fine on #UnfinishedBusiness ‚ÄúWomen entrepreneurs are asked why their businesses won‚Äôt fail whereas men will be asked why their businesses will succeed.‚Äù - @cazzmelbourne on the unconscious bias in entrepreneurship #UnfinishedBusiness @ACCA_melbourne On #MeToo, the stories are so shocking you know the power of norms enabled it to happen. There is very difficult hard work to be done where people will have to speak up and create new powerful messages. - Cordelia Fine #UnfinishedBusiness @ACCA_melbourne Tolerance for #MeToo is about connecting unconscious bias with the underlying beliefs that boys will be boys and girls will be girls. - Cordelia Fine #UnfinishedBusiness @ACCA_melbourne @cazzmelbourne Unconscious bias workshops are about taking people‚Äôs beliefs from ‚Äúthis is what men and women are‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is what men and women should be‚Äù #UnfinishedBusiness The fears of instilling quotas are about compromising merit. But what if our concept of merit is masculine in the first place? #UnfinishedBusiness @ACCA_melbourne Real diversity is about having different people using different traits and different skills to tackle difficult problems #UnfinishedBusiness  Cordelia Fine on her award winning book, ‚ÄúTesterone Rex‚Äù: I wanted to write something which was accessible to the general population which challenged the scientific assumptions of gender, rather than a journal article for academics. #UnfinishedBusiness A public policy suggestion by @cazzmelbourne and Cordelia Fine to create a more equitable society:
mandatory parental leave for men. Men should not miss out on spending time with their children and families. #UnfinishedBusiness @ACCA_melbourne It is hard to feel confidence about your prospects when you are not adequately represented in leadership in your industry, sector or workplace. 

Fantastic end to a thoughtful discussion on the #UnfinishedBusiness of feminism. Thanks to @ACCA_melbourne &amp; Trawalla Foundation!  @EastwoodSane @ACCA_melbourne In the context of the conversation it is the traits that are defined by societal norms as masculine, but an interesting point you raise! It is a complex term to unpack. Conducting fieldwork gives our students a deeper insight into how Melbourne has created a narrative for itself as the world's most liveable city.

The conservation of cultural materials is crucial to a high functioning society #RobynSloggett  Loss of significant materials impede the ability of the societies to form their collective identity #RobynSloggett #RobynSloggett references Chinua Achebe's 1958 text, "Things Fall Apart" on how the loss of materials lead to a loss in the continuity of ideas, practices and identity which form a sense of identity The Grimwade Centre for Cultural Materials Conservation acknowledges that Australia has 80,000 years of knowledge and objects  The first example #RobynSloggett makes in the case for conservation is Yackandandah‚Äôs 1902 centenerary celebration The Cunningham Tannery allowed locals to produce leather which helped produce a symbolic artwork to celebrate the occasion  Linguistics student helped the collections team translate the pages of Roland Carter‚Äôs diary for the archives which detail a story of a refugee couple in 1947  Roland Carter‚Äôs story of friendship, war, redemption and Leonhard Adam‚Äôs accounts of various communities couldn‚Äôt have been discovered without this single letter  These are the waterholes and life-giving water - the paintings are an account of and identify the shifts in spiritual practice in Wadeye in the early 20th century. #RobynSloggett  Physical records are not the only way that knowledge is passed onto others #RobynSloggett Cultural materials and collections are crucial to sustaining a healthy ecology of knowledge #RobynSloggett Photographs are as much of a symbol of technology in the 19th and 20th century as they are of showing people, places and history. #RobynSloggett The ochre paintings damaged in the 2011 Warmun floods were dried for three weeks before being sent to @unimelb‚Äôs @Cultcons for restoration. The paintings were given back to community.  It is no coincidence that during war books are burnt and records are destroyed - the freedom to information is a fundamental human right #RobynSloggett Conservators provide the scientific rigour, dexterity, interdisciplinary and cross-cultural knowledge to help preserve community identities #RobynSloggett To reduce information assymetry and  increase access to cultural materials, @unimelb‚Äôs Grimwade Centre @Cultcons is working with Gidja community leaders to teach their next generation about the importance of maintaining significant cultural materials  Cultural materials are essential if societies and communities are to understand and critique its own significant historical narrative Cultural materials and collections, in the era of fake news, is an important pioneer of authenticity for society today. #RobynSloggett Thanks for joining us tonight for #RobynSloggett, the first of the 2018 Dean‚Äôs Lecture Series.

Gareth Evans #KoreanPeninsula Can we trust North Korea or Trump on demilitarisation? It would be a leap of faith in the #KoreanPeninsula - Gareth Evans The trust deficit towards Kim but there is also a gigantic trust deficit when the North Koreans look at America based off the US‚Äô changes in Iraq and how they are trying to renege in Iran #KoreanPeninsula  With North Korea becoming a nuclear power, Gareth Evans thinks they will be willing to give up their nuclear weapons if they are given sufficient respect in return #KoreanPeninsula How far can China support North Korea? At the end of the day, China wants to see the #KoreanPeninsula as a stable region with denuclearisation on both sides - Gareth Evans Evans: I don‚Äôt believe in today‚Äôs world, that it is economically viable for China to be on a conquest to take over the Asia-Pacific, despite recent developments in Vanuatu #KoreanPeninsula There is so much regional pressure on Trump to ensure the summit does go ahead for stability that the Kim-Trump summit will happen. However, Trump has consistently been inconsistent - Gareth Evans #KoreanPeninsula The sensible administration in South Korea who are paving the way to good dialogue with North Korea, and China‚Äôs desire for stability will ensure the #KoreanPeninsula will not spiral out of control - Gareth Evans Alexis Wright, member of the Waanyi Nation and the Boisbouvier Chair in Australian Literature at @unimelb, has received the 2018 Stella Prize for Tracker, the collective memoir of Aboriginal leader and visionary Tracker Tilmouth! üëèüëèüëè

 Testerone Rex challenges the link between hormones and risk-taking or other competitive behaviour, says @unimelb's philosopher of science Cordelia Fine #knownextnow  Risk-taking is seen through a masculine lens, and the ways that women take risk are often invisible in the discussion #knownextnow What is Cordelia Fine's response to criticisms of confirmation bias?

"I'm focused on the science and the evidence. You can't do science without background assumptions, and those will influence the research questions, the participants and sample size." #knownextnow My work has focused on bringing out background assumptions and seeing how they have played out in other areas in science. #knownextnow The business case for diversity? Bringing out the best from a wide range of people, new families, fostering positive and inclusive workplace cultures, says @unimelb Cordelia Fine #knownextnow There is also a moral case for diversity that is often hidden: providing equal opportunities and access to employment #knownextnow On writing about complex, academic ideas to be accessible for a mass audience: Cordelia Fine says that making academic ideas accessible is important in helping academics communicate clearly without jargon. #knownextnow On #MeToo, we have to make people feel that they will be listened to and respected by their peers and the organisation #knownextnow #MeToo also redefines risk, giving women the power to define risk in the workplace and to articulate the solution Learning how to communicate using your values and appealing to other people's values is a powerful and practical way to help tackle ethical issues #knownextnow  In five to ten years, I'd like to see my research to have been successful in resisting and reducing the polarisation of feminism in the science community, says @unimelb science philosopher Cordelia Fine #knownextnow  Thanks for joining us in our coverage of #mkw18 and thank you to @wheelercentre for hosting us! @heyDejan @unimelb @wheelercentre @bhakthi .@knowledgemelb and @wheelercentre will hopefully know the answer to this! üòä Oppressed by religion or a more complex affair?

Prof Rebekah Brown, Director of @MonashMSDI
Kath Rowley @DELWP_Vic ED #ClimateChange
@VeenaSahajwalla from @UNSW
@RobynSchofield3 from @UniMelb

#NatureSustInAus  Modernising Govt departments for sustainability is a key reform in decision making, says Kath Rowley, @DELWP_Vic ED #ClimateChange .. for instance, integrating health outcomes with @EPA_Victoria. #NatureSustInAus Professor @VeenaSahajwalla reflecting on the work of @UNSW‚Äôs Centre for Sustainable Materials Research &amp; Technology: having science and engineering looking beyond the technical processes to their impacts puts heads and hearts together for better decision-making. #NatureSustInAus Experiments in labs do end up in factories in the real world - @VeenaSahajwalla reflecting on using waste tyres in making steel to recycle and lower manufacturing‚Äôs carbon footprint ‚ôªÔ∏è üë£ #NatureSustInAus Some great stats from @VeenaSahajwalla: the amount of copper in e-waste can be more than 10x that of the original mined material .. in the case of gold, more than 40x raw gold ore! Sustainability is an opportunity. #NatureSustInAus

 Academic disciplinary silos &amp; government‚Äôs departmental silos don‚Äôt align, but in govt major new policy problems force collaboration says Kath Rowley. #NatureSustInAus Rebekah Brown from @MonashMSDI reflecting that while @arc_gov_au might be lagging in promoting interdisciplinarity, big international philanthropists such as @GatesFoundation &amp; @RockefellerFdn are leading the way. #NatureSustInAus Thanks to our amazing, all ‚ôÄÔ∏è  @NatureSustainab panel discussing interface between research and policy, and our facilitator @Ha_Tanya!

As our city grows, so does inequality between the inner and outer suburbs. Our new research (released today) shows that Melbourne‚Äôs rapid population growth in the outer fringe is polarising the city socially and economically.  MSSI is fortunate to be involved in the development of this film with award-winning director Damon Gameau. It's a brilliant film - in cinemas from May 23.

Please spread the word and let our children know that there are solutions and there are people who care deeply about their future. Increasing inequality, social, congestion and productivity costs are linked with infrastructure spending that has been way too low to meet the needs of the rapidly growing population.  "None of us know exactly how our journey into a harsh climate future will  evolve. We can be sure that the journey will be far tougher if we close our eyes and fail to act with honesty and imagination; wisdom and courage".
