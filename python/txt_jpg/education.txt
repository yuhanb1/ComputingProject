Are they getting sufficient change? #RevolutionSchool Hattie: Parents can be incredibly important in terms of expectations, encouragement & how they talk to kids about learning #RevolutionSchool John Hattie says the biggest effects of parents is the expectations & encouragement they give #RevolutionSchool "I'd like to see my children traveling the road that I didn't travel" #RevolutionSchool showing the different expectations on kids You might not always be the best but if you do your best, you will get the best result for you #RevolutionSchool People will look at the school's NAPLAN results and make judgements, says Principal Michael Muscat #RevolutionSchool Numeracy & literacy are the building blocks for all the other things we do in schooling says Prof John Hattie #RevolutionSchool In 2008 Kambrya's English results were in the bottom 5%, just a few yrs later they lifted to the top 25% of state schools #RevolutionSchool For every student to maximise their potential, strong literacy skills are non-negotiable says Principal Michael Muscat #RevolutionSchool More than 60% of Aus school children are not frequent readers #RevolutionSchool The whole reason is to read better but if you're not actually reading then what's it for? asks Literacy Expert Di Snowball #RevolutionSchool Large-scale change in a school environment can be an excruciating experience for the staff says Principal Michael Muscat #RevolutionSchool 1 in 4 Australian secondary students don't complete year 12 #RevolutionSchool Prof Hattie: From yr 9 onwards, every yr that you stay at school has a dramatic effect on your health, wealth & happiness #RevolutionSchool Health, wealth & happiness as an adult - it's not so much your achievement at school but staying on to finish that matters #RevolutionSchool Pioneering Darrabi program has helped reduce dropout rates for disengaged/disruptive students at Kambrya #RevolutionSchool Darrabi Teacher Marty MacDonald: First I have to build a relationship with these students and build up their trust #RevolutionSchool Darrabi Teacher Marty MacDonald: The reason I became a teacher is for the satisfaction of helping. To help others succeed #RevolutionSchool Hattie: Once a kid has a sense of where they fall in the classroom, it's really hard to change - they often know by age 8 #RevolutionSchool Hattie: Surely one of our jobs as teachers is to find things in kids that they didn't know they were good at & show them #RevolutionSchool "I look up at a lot of the yr 12s & I think how am I ever going to survive?" - #RevolutionSchool showing student pressures to perform When dealing with children you never write them off. But you expect them to make an effort. To take opportunities #RevolutionSchool I'm a bit of a dag. I think it's important that the kids see that you're human, says Assistant Principal Keith Perry #RevolutionSchool I'm strict & direct but I like to think that the kids see me as someone who will support them says A/Principal Keith Perry #RevolutionSchool The test was a complete failure through their lack of effort more than knowledge - that's scary says Marty MacDonald #RevolutionSchool Marty MacDonald: Sometimes you almost second-guess yourself as their teacher, are you the right person to help them? #RevolutionSchool It's critical that every teacher believes & demonstrates they can make a difference to every kid: John Hattie #revolutionschool DinSnowball introducing new reading program at Kambrya... but needs to take the school's teachers with her #RevolutionSchool Higher achieving students read 3 times more than lower achieving students: Di Snowball #RevolutionSchool Kambrya is part of @unimelb network of schools that shares success and knowledge #RevolutionSchool We know that the more children read the higher test scores, the more they can understand everything else in their lives #RevolutionSchool Giving the Darrabi boys anopportunity to unite as a team and build resilience #RevolutionSchool Most Australians correctly believe that an unhappy home life can have a negative effect on student learning #RevolutionSchool The windy days and the full moons make kids go a little bit trippy... #RevolutionSchool Kids have bought into literacy program very quickly.... to see them actively engaged in texts is pure happiness! #RevolutionSchool Reading is beyond having independent reading of small texts, need to instil a love of reading #RevolutionSchool Independent reading programs are rare in Australia. Due to pressure of fitting in with curriculum? #RevolutionSchool Borrowing from school library jumped by 25% once independent reading was introduced #RevolutionSchool Next week Kambrya introduces a wellbeing program with the support of @ProfLeaWaters #RevolutionSchool Listen: Prof Field Rickards on @3RRRFM discussing @ABCTV landmark series #RevolutionSchool http://bit.ly/1WE5EXJ pic.twitter.com/Z9sPnenFoW Watch Prof Farrell's #DeansLecture on workforce literacy & the digital revolution: http://bit.ly/1WEjc5x  #edchatpic.twitter.com/qQ3CCskdIt Should secondary students read books in school? @TimnaJacks explores in #RevolutionSchool episode 2 recap in @theage http://m.theage.com.au/victoria/schools-ditching-books-in-class-you-cant-be-serious-20160608-gpe38x.html … Next week's #RevolutionSchool gets "beyond contentious moments to look at underlying causes & means of abating them" http://bit.ly/1PJa0L0  All the best to our @shiralee_poed & @shades_of_hal who are both presenting at today's @AASEPASS2016 http://bit.ly/1taZPEG  #AASE_PASS2016 Edu expert Prof Hattie's upcoming #DeansLecture sold out in less than 48 hours.

How do you teach wellbeing? #RevolutionSchool up soon on @ABCTV Kids as young as 7 are being clinically diagnosed with depression & anxiety, says @ProfLeaWaters @UOMpospsych #RevolutionSchool This part of Melbourne knows the tragic consequences of poor mental health. Suicide cluster a fews yrs ago had huge impact #RevolutionSchool In every school there's 1-2% who are really struggling with mental health issues, says Andrew Reeves, Head of Wellbeing #RevolutionSchool Assistant Principal Jo Wastle says we have to take every warning sign very seriously #RevolutionSchool Good mental health ranks especially high in John Hattie's @VisibleLearning global study of factors that impact on learning #RevolutionSchool Emotions are our feeling, reaction, interaction with others. It's how people see us. Our core being, says John Hattie #RevolutionSchool Principal says wellbeing not an airey fairy exercise. It's about developing programs that build self-awareness, resilience #RevolutionSchool If you have a mental illness during adolescence, you are 3 times more likely to re-experience in adult life:@ProfLeaWaters #RevolutionSchool To learn more about the Visible Wellbeing approach check out  Hope to give kids tools to pull themselves out of scenario & engage more, so they feel better as a person & learner #RevolutionSchool Teacher Mel Jolly says it's important for students to understand who they are, so they appreciate what they are good at #RevolutionSchool The 4 day hike is not going to be easy. They will have a tough time, build a bit of resilience, character & work as team #RevolutionSchool Students who join half way through year find it challenging, sometimes act out to get known & become popular in wrong ways #RevolutionSchool People generally won’t talk about suicide with their kids cos they are scared. Any discussion is worthwhile says Jo Wastle #RevolutionSchool Rachel says it was good because her mum understood that she needed more space and freedom #RevolutionSchool Most Aussies believe class size & homework have big impact on success, but there are far bigger impacts closer to home #RevolutionSchool John Hattie: Teenagers are under significant pressure. Support & encouragement is the most critical thing family can give #RevolutionSchool With anything you try in a school there's 45 things that interrupt best laid plan-Sarah Hewat on start of wellbeing trial  #RevolutionSchool Physically it sucked but I felt so proud of myself, says student Michael after 62.5km 3 night hike with 20kg pack #RevolutionSchool The age old game of cat & mouse between student & teacher begins. Chasing up students who haven't handed in coursework #RevolutionSchool 45 out of 96 vocational students missed coursework deadline & need to come in on holidays #RevolutionSchool The Darrabi boys have gone from academic freefall to all passing maths test. Time away on camp has helped them focus #RevolutionSchool You can't have good quality student outcomes without having relationships with students: Assist. Principal Keith Perry #RevolutionSchool Many kids think school isn't for them but once in 20s they realise opportunities dramatically constrained: John Hattie #RevolutionSchool @ProfLeaWaters crafts formula of success. Exam performance = content knowledge + taking care of your wellbeing #RevolutionSchool Visible Wellbeing shifts wellbeing to a tangible, observable phenomenon. See:  Because of Visible Wellbeing trial students are much more self aware about stress, why they are stressed & how they know #RevolutionSchool John Hattie says we should have a responsibility for teaching notion of wellbeing & respect for self & others #RevolutionSchool In Kambrya's darkest days 12 students were expelled in 1 year. The Darrabi program has reduced expulsions to 0 #RevolutionSchoo Student says @ProfLeaWaters Visible Wellbeing program has helped a lot with stress: "We calm down & learn more" #RevolutionSchool For more info about the Wellbeing Profiler tool that measures student wellbeing see http://www.wbprofiler.com.au/  #RevolutionSchool @UOMpospsych 81% of students feel more confident about taking care of their wellbeing thanks to Visible Wellbeing trial #RevolutionSchool Visible Wellbeing not only giving kids a sense of happiness, satisfaction & resilence, also a chance to learn #RevolutionSchool While further research is needed, Visible Wellbeing clearly holds great promise: @ProfLeaWaters  Not always easy for parents to see kids becoming independent.

Teaching is far too complex for one person, we need to work together in collaborative teams says Prof Field Rickardspic.twitter.com/1mtnMXQonT Prof Field Rickards: We need a long-term targeted strategy to respond to a serious long-term decline. Understand! We are filming the event & will share video ASAP.  Also accepting questions online: https://todaysmeet.com/educationspending … Prof Field Rickards: Educational progress requires a 15-20 year bipartisan vision of investment. Rickards: Change will only occur in Australia when it is driven by teachers, who are supported so they can become highly developed experts Education provides a greater return on government investment than any other area of government policy says @GMastersACER @GMastersACER:Much past public spending on edu has not delivered improvements because it has not been targeted on proven strategies Massive improvements would be made in the quality & equity of Aus schooling if all teachers taught as effectively as most effective teachers Prof Barry MCGaw: we need to have fewer teachers and pay them more Prof McGaw: my proposal is to have fewer teachers, to pay them more, to have more restricted entry into teacher education programs #ausvotes We've tripled our investment on early childhood education, however public spending is low compared to other OECD countries says Prof Tayler Aus edu system outcomes are good but have been slipping back for over a decade reiterates Prof Collette Tayler Prof Tayler: ECCE is one place that could make a big difference if child learning & development goals led the policy & funding decisions @glenncsavage: simply, funding decides “who gets what” & reflects both the values of gov & what is considered to be “in the public interest” We need to forge a more nuanced & generative terrain of debate by focusing on "targeted investment” in schools says @glenncsavage @glenncsavage: we have those who see funding as the ‘magic bullet’ to fix all problems, & those who tells us funding doesn’t matter at all Through collaboration we can do more than if we work on our own says @unimelb Network of Schools Director Katherine Henderson Katherine Henderson talks about the need for targeted funding #ausvotes Prin Michael Muscat: We were a school on our knees &amp; we went back to basics - literacy &amp; numeracy #RevolutionSchool  Principal Michael Muscat: We need to build instructional capacity among our teachers &amp; get them to work collaboratively #ausvotes We are already over supplying the teaching market says Prof Barry McGaw If we need fewer teachers, do we need fewer education faculties? asks @McKewMax We face a big challenge as a country to raise the status as teaching as a profession says @GMastersACER @acereduau #ausvotes We need to set higher standards, more control over who starts teacher education and also who gets registration says @GMastersACER We need to capture what we do know, identify those teachers &amp; schools w best practise &amp; share this across the profession says @GMastersACER It's a myth - we never implemented the gonski ideal says @glenncsavage #ausvotes Not all important things that come out of needs based funding can be easily quantified says @glenncsavage #ausvotes Schools need to be given the flexibility to tailor, innovate and adapt programs for local contexts says @glenncsavage Thanks all for great education policy debate &amp; line-up.

Stay tuned for post-event video Prof Hattie on the narrative of "success" - it's time for a reboot #deanslecture  Prof Hattie shares his five goals in education #deanslecture  Prof Hattie: Focus effort and resources on supporting teachers to work together to add at least 1 yrs growth for a year's input #deanslecute Why is Aus education going backwards? We are serving the top 40% of students the least says Prof Hattie #deanslecture Prof Hattie: We're driving down our maths and science participation and success  What do we see in our schools? Students sitting alone, working alone, doing assignments alone - that's not the real world. We need a reboot Hattie: Why do we give parents the belief that school choice matters? It does not matter what school students go to. #deanslecture The biggest factor for health, wealth and happiness is not the highest achievement at school, it's the number of years in high school Are we dumbing down teacher education? asks Prof John Hattie #deanslecture  Prof John Hattie: We should stop seeing postcodes as a destination #deanslecture Prof Hattie: Postcode, remote location is not the problem. It's about focusing on the impact #deanlecture  Prof Hattie asks how do we become a profession that acknowledges its expertise?#DeansLecture  My mission - we need to start to introduce this notion of expertise  What do we mean by impact asks Prof John Hattie? #DeansLecture  Prof Hattie: Let's not have another curriculum that decides how much "stuff" we can fit in #deanslecture Prof John Hattie: We've got to stop appeasing the parents  Hattie: We've switched from how do we get the best out of our kids to how can we appease the parents #DeansLecture Prof Hattie: We need to change the narrative - it's time for a reboot Prof Hattie shares the success of #RevolutionSchool Kambrya College #DeansLecture  Prof John Hattie: I have a new campaign, I want Michael Muscat for Australian of the Year #RevolutionSchool #DeansLecture Prof Hattie asks how do we reboot our narrative, so high growth &amp; expertise is valued in our schools?  #DeansLecture What resources do we have to help teachers do their progress work? #DeansLecture  Do we get students to come to school to listen to the teacher talk? #DeansLecture  Prof John Hattie: Wouldn't it be great if we had actual dialogue about what happens in the classroom? #DeansLecture  Prof Hattie: doing more of the same is going in the wrong direction #DeansLecture Hattie: We need to start early and bring the concept of learning into early childhood education #DeansLecture  Prof Diane Mayer, President @AustCollEd congratulates Prof Hattie on an outstanding #DeansLecture  @ABCTV #RevolutionSchool up soon. Will Talsif focus for exams? Who will become school captain? Will Darrabi boys fit into mainstream class? Over the last 5 or 6 years, Kambrya enrolments have been steadily declining. Partly because of increased competition #RevolutionSchool Each year Kambrya loses around a significant amount of its students to selective and private schools nearby #RevolutionSchool John Hattie: It's really challenging for Kambrya to compete. Partly because of messages that it's a government school #RevolutionSchool 60% of Australian students attend public schools, but more and more are abandoning the public system #RevolutionSchool #RevolutionSchool survey reveals most Aussies believe results are better at private schools &amp; that wealthier schools have better teachers John Hattie: It’s very very hard to find evidence that there is a major difference between public &amp; private schools #RevolutionSchool If you go to the richest schools in this country you'll find the same teacher variability as the poorest: John Hattie #RevolutionSchool Impressing the local community is no easy task. A good reputation is hard won and easily lost #RevolutionSchool And here is Kambrya's own Mr G!! @camdenham #RevolutionSchool By the end of long &amp; challenging year... the teachers are very tired: Principal Michael Muscat #RevolutionSchool 25% of teachers report emotional exhaustion &amp; burnout. Often only a few years into the job #RevolutionSchool @john_hattie: Burnout and low teacher morale are big problems. About half of teachers leave in first five years #RevolutionSchool I've seen a lot of teachers not enjoying it anymore, just over it. I don't want to be in that position, says Debbie Blee #RevolutionSchool There's always room for improvement. You can be a good teacher, but you can always be a better teacher #RevolutionSchool Leaving school early dramatically effects what happens to you in terms of your health, wealth and later life: John Hattie #RevolutionSchool John Hattie: 97% of adults in prison in Victoria did not finish high school #RevolutionSchool Statistically the number of years spent in high school has a greater impact than a student's academic standard #RevolutionSchool In Kambrya's relentless quest to improve they are trialling a new tool for analysing teacher performance: @V_Classroom #RevolutionSchool It's quite daunting to have someone type away everything you say. It's like exercise... painful says Deb Blee @V_Classroom #RevolutionSchool John Hattie: We measure the amount of time a teacher talks, qns &amp; 30 factors that make a difference to quality of learning #RevolutionSchool We're trying to increase the amount of conversation between students &amp; teachers, reduce teacher talk, says John Hattie #RevolutionSchool @V_Classroom shows that Ms Blee has asked an average of 81 questions per class... but talked nearly 100% of the time #RevolutionSchool Most teachers say they talk 30-40% of time, but it's actually 80-90%. Realising that is pretty powerful: John Hattie #RevolutionSchool We have to find space for student questions, student interaction. For teachers to listen to students to find out impact #RevolutionSchool John Hattie: If you're talking all the time how do you know your impact? That requires you to shut-up #RevolutionSchool @V_Classroom Want feedback on your teaching?

You've done it all before...We love you, &amp; we're proud of you, but get an A #RevolutionSchool Interesting to see exam pressure from teacher's perspective.... high heart rate and all #RevolutionSchool A school has flexibility, but also responsibility to offer opportunities for student to demonstrate their understanding #RevolutionSchool How would you feel if you had Prof John Hattie observing your classroom teaching?  #RevolutionSchool Forensic analysis of what goes on in classroom helps determine what works &amp; what doesn't. It's called clinical teaching #RevolutionSchool Clinical teaching: Often you see teachers starting off by checking where kids are at &amp; what they understood #RevolutionSchool Clinical teaching: Constantly evaluating if students understand &amp; whether you are having an impact #RevolutionSchool Diagnose, intervene, evaluate. That's the core of clinical teaching: John Hattie #RevolutionSchool If students think they can learn from you they are more likely to learn, says John Hattie #RevolutionSchool If you focus on improving your teaching, that makes you a better teacher.

The focus they've had this year on enhancing the quality of teaching has paid off  #RevolutionSchool Complacency is killing education in Australia. Decline in performance of students is pretty dire: John Hattie #RevolutionSchool Prof Hattie: If we don't change by 2020-25 we will continue to slide down world rankings &amp; be in a very bad situation #RevolutionSchool Need to empower schools to develop a strong vision, stable leadership &amp; strong sense of what will work for students #RevolutionSchool As far as Kambrya College goes, I think the best is yet to come: Principal Michael Muscat #RevolutionSchool We just get stronger &amp; stronger every year.

Literature has political function in society says @LarissaMcD1 #EducatingAus The longer children are in schools, the more similar they should become, right? This isn't true. It's the opposite, says @GMastersACER We need to be thinking about how we can get children onto trajectories of success before school says @GMastersACER #EducatingAus An equitable school system would be one where every child's school needs are identified and addressed says @GMastersACER Trying to close gaps focusing on different demographic groups doesn't work says @GMastersACER #EducatingAus Every individual regardless of age, gender, SES - we must try to meet their edu needs. That's equity says @GMastersACER #EducatingAus What we do know, what's going to make biggest diff in performance in our schools is the teacher says @GMastersACER #EducatingAus Let's be clear about what high effective teaching looks like says @GMastersACER #EducatingAus Teacher educators also need to keep learning - we need a system approach to support prof development says @LarissaMcD1 #EducatingAus If we're thinking about the whole student, we need to think about the whole system says @LarissaMcD1 #EducatingAus Tom Bentley concludes: Build the community. Be political. Stand out. Speak.

The stakes are pretty high for lifting achievement. This is the right moment says Gill Callister How do we spread and embed our successes? asks Gill Callister @DETVic #EducatingAus Timing is crucial and these ideas are powerful. 2017 must be led by careful, long term thinking says  Gill Callister #EducatingAus @DETVic Annnd that's a wrap on our #EducatingAus book event spam for the evening.

There's a common narrative let's use it - Hattie #ozschoolpolicy Data is important. We need a national view of what's going on in the country, not just one state in isolation  @DrSueThomson #ozschoolpolicy We've got great data here in Australia but we don't use it says @DrSueThomson  @acereduau #ozschoolpolicy We keep analysing the data and reporting on similar things but no one is listening to what we are saying @DrSueThomson #ozschoolpolicy We need a national view of what's going on in the country says @DrSueThomson #ozschoolpolicy It's too easy to focus on kids behaving badly without getting into the why's &amp; what's underlining that.That's what's missing #ozschoolpolicy It's too easy to get caught up in funding. We've got to open up the conversation and move away from just good/bad @ACARA_CEO #ozschoolpolicy Federal involvement is necessary to ensure equality - needs a presence around funding to ensure a fair go. @boblingard86 #ozschoolpolicy It's not just a question of funding, it's how you spend &amp; target it says @boblingard86  @UQ_News #ozschoolpolicy  The Whitlam rationale was right - federal involvement was right to ensure equality of opportunity says @boblingard86 #ozschoolpolicy There's a few realities here. Ministers are political animals and they want announcements that distinguish them @john_hattie #ozschoolpolicy Ever dollar that the federal governments have given the states, the states have reduced that dollar says @john_hattie #ozschoolpolicy Why would you fund that things that do the most harm to kids? Asks @john_hattie #ozschoolpolicy It's so hard to get common narrative. If we accept more money isn't the magic bullet the evidence is contest. @glenncsavage #ozschoolpolicy Collecting that evidence about what works is the role of the federal government and investing @DrSueThomson #ozschoolpolicy 60 principal groups.What's their purpose?It's hardly ever debate, mostly resources &amp; autonomy. Constituency fighting alongside @john_hattie National curriculum - one the criticism was we consulted too much. We changed too much says @ACARA_CEO #ozschoolpolicy If schools adapted the curriculum  - we need to ask why &amp; learn from this says @ACARA_CEO we need to find ways to keep the discussing going You've got to keep focus on what you want kids to learn and how to best represent it says @ACARA_CEO #ozschoolpolicy In assessment space, it's a big area. We need to build capacity for assessments @ACARA_CEO #ozschoolpolicy Judge things on quality, not on those with the loudest voice says @ACARA_CEO #ozschoolpolicy What's the influence of the OCED and testing programs? @DrSueThomson explores #ozschoolpolicy @acereduau We focus on #PISA but from teaching perspective we get a lot more from #TIMMS that can inform what we're doing @DrSueThomson #ozschoolpolicy We learn what's happening in the earlier years in TIMMS &amp; PIRLS to improve later yrs but we just focus on PISA @DrSueThomson #ozschoolpolicy I'm not interested in the magic bullets, they come with major history and major cost says @john_hattie #ozschoolpolicy We need to work with our data and learn from it @DrSueThomson #ozschoolpolicy Have you got the courage to scale up excellence? I'm not interested in the magic bullets - @john_hattie #ozschoolpolicy Let's shift the discussion to gain and improvement says @ACARA_CEO #ozschoolpolicy Let's connect data up to get the narrative on schools, teachers &amp; kids outcomes argues @ACARA_CEO #ozschoolpolicy We've seen a deepening in inequality across all rich nations. We need a complementary set of policies to address inequality @boblingard86 Need to look at the success schools are having w Aboriginal kids. We need to drive it as a wedge - it can be done, it's being done - Hattie Biggest problem is Aboriginal kids who are above average, no one cares about them. Let's change the narrative @john_hattie #ozschoolpolicy Massive deficit notion of Aboriginal underachievement.1/2 Aboriginal kids are above the average.No one talks about it:Hattie #OzSchoolPolicy Teachers need more time out the classroom for reflection, to work together argues @DrSueThomson #OzSchoolPolicy We could take ourselves out of the current struggle we have and come up w a proposition says @ACARA_CEO #ozschoolpolicy It's possible to say for these learning outcomes, we know broadly what levers are needed @ACARA_CEO  #OzSchoolPolicy We don't have a good narrative in this country about outcomes says @john_hattie  #OzSchoolPolicy We have a huge equity problem in this country, and it's often silenced says @boblingard86 #OzSchoolPolicy We have all this data, there's a lot to be learned but we don't use it says @boblingard86 #OzSchoolPolicy It is the narrative of expertise we have to protect. How do we get that on the table argues @john_hattie  #OzSchoolPolicy Put funding to a statutory authority run by experts some distance from political process &amp; try get equity @boblingard86 #OzSchoolPolicy We need to use the data we have. There's a lot to be learnt but I don't think we move to the next policy step. @boblingard86 #OzSchoolPolicy AITSL is disaffected by being owned by the minister. Would be better as statutory authority argues @boblingard86 #OzSchoolPolicy It's about having a place for the profession to participate in the policymaking and have that voice says @boblingard86 #OzSchoolPolicy Join us 4 April to hear A/Prof Hao explore #highered accreditation in Vietnam:current status, challenges &amp; learnings  #WorldHappinessReport2017 reveals Nordic countries are the happiest.

More often teachers &amp; their teaching was being measured against their impact &amp; influence says @janet_clinton @ITEERH While we might try to examine all characteristics of effective teaching, we're doing it in an ad hoc way says @janet_clinton @ITEERH Prof @janet_clinton explores what an effective evaluation system looks like  You need a good evaluation workforce at every level from school to a national level. Who understand &amp; believe in evaluation: @janet_clinton  Teacher effectiveness &amp; its contribution is multidimensional says @janet_clinton @ITEERH  Evaluation measures and methods need to be valid, reliable, consistent &amp; unbiased says @janet_clinton @ITEERH  There's a lot of work to do in Australia. Currently, teacher evaluation procedures are highly variable says @janet_clinton  There's no doubt that there are pockets of excellence that we can learn from says @janet_clinton @ITEERH What can we define as teacher effectiveness, and how can we measure it? Asks @janet_clinton @ITEERH Our methods need to be appropriate to what we consider teacher effectiveness says @janet_clinton @ITEERH We want change - we want our educators to consider themselves as evaluators. Doing the same old isn't going to cut it says @janet_clinton While we have the standards, I'm not convinced that we have the right measures in place says @Lisa_CEOAITSL @ITEERH  It's almost agreed that teaching is a clinical and research based practice - so we need to use evidence says @Lisa_CEOAITSL @ITEERH Teachers want to know how they're doing. We haven't given them the tools to measure impact, we need to step into this space @Lisa_CEOAITSL As we move forward, we have challenges of what &amp; how we measure, and we have challenges of how it might be used @Lisa_CEOAITSL @ITEERH Anthony Mackay @CSEAus facilitating tonight's @ITEERH forum debate &amp; discussion  Acting Dean Prof Lesley Farrell wraps up tonight's @ITEERH &amp; encourages participants to continue the debate &amp; conversation Join us next Tues 11 April for the launch of new book, Knowledge at the Crossroads? w/ lead author Prof Lyn Yates  Hard work, low pay &amp; no stability in sight - find out why life’s not all selfies and Snapchat for Gen Y  Great to see coverage of @AustAmFulbright scholar @Rae4Learning speaking at @UTAS_ design forum on @projectILETC  See the recently released @ITEERH report: Teacher Effectiveness Systems, Frameworks and Measures: A Review  With so much emphasis on #STEM education, how can we use the arts to create learning opportunities?
