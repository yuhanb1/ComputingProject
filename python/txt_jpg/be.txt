#busecomelbalumni #unimelb #uomalumni  Dr Michal Carrington and @youralarmbells join @alimoore004 for a discussion on the dark side of modern work. #foundationdinner2019 #busecomelb #busecomelbalumni #unimelb  ‚ÄúThe issue is that there is a lot of confusion. When the consumer is trying to figure out what to do, they categorise: ‚Äòis this person actually a slave?‚Äô They do this based on choice and voice.‚Äù Dr Michal Carrington
#unimelb #busecomelb #modernwork ‚ÄúWe are probably going to end up with some kind of third, hybrid [category of work]. If that comes to pass it cuts away the legs of many gig business models.‚Äù @youralarmbells 

#unimelb #busecomelb #modernwork ‚ÄúWhen we put ourselves in the shoes of a slave, when it comes to adults we tend to say ‚Äòwell why don‚Äôt they do something about it?‚Äô‚Äù - Dr Michal Carrington

Now is a good time to review them. #mef2014 Ross Garnaut: Australia is currently at a financial inflection point. #mef2014 Prof Kevin Davis now to discuss competition and stability #mef2014 Davis: There is a long term debate about the benefits of competition and stability #mef2014 Davis: All models assume that shareholders are able to adequately assess risk #mef2014 Davis: Current debates around financial system reform tend to relate to bank capital requirements rather than interest rate policy #mef2014 There are many issues on how effectively consumers can compare &amp; understand the financial products they are buying - Prof Davis #mef2014 Davis: Competition is clearly important but with caveats. We need to assess effectiveness &amp; technology presents big challenges #mef2014 Governor Glenn Stevens of @RBAInfo takes to mic to present his comments #mef2014 http://t.co/o8tc69eVnQ It is widely accepted that that the regulatory system served us reasonably well during #GFC says Glenn Stevens of @RBAInfo #mef2014 The largest banks had nothing like enough capital during the #GFC says Glenn Stevens of @RBAInfo #mef2014 The Murray Inquiry has the capability to help us understand why we did relatively well during the #GFC - @RBAInfo Glenn Stevens #mef2014 Too big to fail?

Our politicians wouldn't let it happen. #mef2014 Discussion shifts to negative gearing. #mef2014 Garnaut suggests that capitalisation is a bigger issue. #mef2014 Davis on negative gearing. He suggests the issue lays in the preferential treatment it receives in a taxation sense. #mef2014 Chair Ross Garnaut wraps up #mef2014 proceedings, thanking attendees asks @RBAInfo Glenn Stevens for remarks.

He cites Russia as an example #carbonbubble JH: One of the lessons learnt from #GFC is that you never have as much time as you thought #carbonbubble Garnaut &amp; Wood: A deflating #CarbonBubble will expose banks in countries with a strong presence in the coal industry. Hewson: Still not enough transparency about the financial exposure of companies to investment in carbon #carbonbubble Garnaut: Politicians stating support for effective action on climate change would be wise to follow through in deed. #carbonbubble Peter Ryan now hands over to the audience for final stage of Q&amp;A #carbonbubble Question on risk to exports.

Follow the conversation at #freebairn15. #busecomelb http://t.co/SSrwVdxPHS @cullenarius Welcome! We love our Copland Lecture Theatre! @etbe Hi Russell. It's for the video we're capturing of the lecture, sorry. Prof @JohnQuiggin: Why is so much of the present policy debate dominated by the discussion of 'reform'? #freebairn15 Prof Quiggin gives some background on Australia up to the 80s: no solution to the 70s crises, unsustainable postwar policies #freebairn15 Australia reached a crossroads in the 80s with mercantilist and libertarian paths proposed. #freebairn15 Prof @JohnQuiggin: In the 1980s, Australia abandoned mercantilism but did not fully adopt libertarianism. #freebairn15 .@JohnQuiggin: So are today's politicians in Australia still working on the policy issues of the 80s? #freebairn15 Elite policy discussion suggests the Australian public is suffering from 'reform fatigue' #freebairn15 But the reality is that the reform program is exhausted: @JohnQuiggin #freebairn15 Prof @JohnQuiggin calls Australia 'an island of macroeconomic success in a world of policy failure' #freebairn15 The policy problems of 2015: climate change, end of (last?) mining boom, inequality and disadvantage, failure of macro policy #freebairn15 But the key policy problem for 2015 is the knowledge economy, which is where tonight's lecture will focus. #freebairn15 Knowledge rules the economy - the idea of the value chain is dead: @JohnQuiggin  #freebairn15 http://t.co/Fl7qCAwdpB Telling that the world's most valuable corporation doesn't seem to produce anything: it tells you where to find information #freebairn15 So what are the implications of all this for the reform agenda? First, prices and incentives are less relevant. #freebairn15 The financial sector has extracted wealth but not created it (witness the dotcom bubble of the 90s). #freebairn15 Telecoms policy has been a failure: reform has produced a monopolist hostile to innovation #freebairn15 So how do we communicate research and development outcomes to the broad public? Might have been done better in the 80s? #freebairn15 .@JohnQuiggin concluding: experience of 80s reform shows attempt to resist structural change are futile.  #freebairn15 .@JohnQuiggin: The knowledge economy is here and will only become more important.  #freebairn15 Q&amp;A question for @JohnQuiggin on how to ensure knowledge economy is more productive than entertaining videos on the Internet. #freebairn15 @tomdquinn Thanks for joining us tonight! Hope you got a lot from John's lecture. Thanks for following #freebairn15 tonight. Join us on 25 May for the #finch15 lecture with @Harvard's Prof Carmen Reinhardt. #busecomelb @etbe No expert on lighting, but perhaps backlighting creates a useful 'halo of authority'? @etbe Feedback noted - cap on us if it's still there at the next lecture? @NickMGreen Hi Nick.

The answers are disappointing. #finch15 Of the 12 advanced economies that experienced crisis in '07-08, only the US and Germany have recovered. #finch15 http://t.co/yEG5wJioir In crises since 1840s, normally takes 8 years to recover precrisis GDP. The 07-08 wave of crises might bring average closer to 10.  #finch15 Why have the 07-08 crises been so protracted? A major reason is a lack of deleveraging even 10 years later. #finch15 http://t.co/r1wGcjLaeZ ‚ÄòI don't think we've seen the last of the restructurings in Europe‚Äô: #CarmenReinhart #finch15 #CarmenReinhart showing how public debt reduction has not always been orthodox, even in advanced economies #finch15 http://t.co/eCRL74oIC7 How long will quantitative easing last in US and Europe? Historically, tendency is to prolong the low interest rate environment. #finch15 #CarmenReinhart turning to #emergingmarkets: What has the post crisis era meant for them? #finch15 A tendency to overheat: the end of capital flow cycles is often not a pretty sight for #emergingmarkets. #finch15 http://t.co/4Pv153cfum Since the May 2013 tapering announcement, global factors have deteriorated for many #emergingmarkets. #finch15 http://t.co/xC7vvobj56 A chart of private sector domestic credit/GDP: most countries above China have already had banking crises #finch15 http://t.co/lLI59H7M0p Another area of risk: the share of emerging markets with current accounts deficits above 3% has risen markedly. #finch15 #CarmenReinhart's work has shown that current account deficits are usually an early warning indicator for impending crisis. #finch15 #CarmenReinhart: The seeds of crisis are sown during the good times: we don't save during boom times. #finch15 Thanks for joining us for the #finch15 lecture with #CarmenReinhart.

Data shows that very few firms export. #corden15 Prof Neary: The data shows large firms matter for trade. First wave of micro data shows exporting firms are exceptional, rare. #corden15 Data: Only 25.9% of firms export - but those firms account for 98% of export value.  #corden15 .@PeterNeary001: Large firms are important for other reasons: eg, more likely to survive and do more R&amp;D #corden15 http://t.co/wKLDW0Nx0E @rbrtau_ He's very good! But #priorities! Good luck with exams. Neary on Melitz's Theory of Hetergeneous Firms: more productive firms select into exports, globalisation produce 'Matthew effect' #corden15 So, which firms export? #corden15 http://t.co/3C7xYeUgmu What is the 'Matthew effect'? To those that have, more is given. #corden15 http://t.co/P2nLbRpgfH Prof @PeterNeary001: Nothing succeeds like ... core competence. #corden15 Core competence: Multi-product firms dominate exports. #corden15 Recent work on multi-product firms partly based on concept of core competence. #corden15 Prof Neary: costs of production differ across products and all products differentiated from rivals' as well as from each other. #corden15 Why does core competence perspective matter? Globalisation has intrafirm Matthew Effect. Productivity varies across products 1/2 #corden15 Suggests two ways firms compete in world markets: cost and quality 2/2 #corden15 Full effect of globalisation on output: the 'Leaner and Meaner' response #corden15 http://t.co/dfu8dpt6j5 Cost-based competence: product is sold at the lowest price #corden15 http://t.co/TyEdY9IOkD But a firm can compete on another dimension: quality. Investment in brand and products, raising prices. #corden15 http://t.co/6d9mD3plOt So, cost or quality? Quality-based competence is more likely when products are more differentiated. Data supports this. #corden15 A clear negative lesson: Everyone loves small firms but growth does not come from small firms. #corden15 @BusEcoNews: Prof Neary: Sadly, evidence suggests public policy emphasis on small firms is misguided. #corden15 A full house in #TheSpot for Q&amp;A now with Prof @PeterNeary001. #corden15 http://t.co/lUSVmt5bUo @BusEcoNews: Missed our first Periscope into tonight's Corden lecture?

If we remember his answer, it's statistically rarer overall, and ... 1/2 @OBenPotter @PeterNeary001 ... 2/2 the typical model is for small disrupters to be bought by bigger firms. @OBenPotter Most of the specific companies you've mentioned have grown through that Matthew Effect.

Rebecca Dee Bradbury #biztransformation Research shows that fear is the most contagious emotion. The good news is calm is the second most contagious emotion. #biztransformation Courageous acts in the form of vulnerability are the key to authentic leadership and empowerment. #biztransformation #rebeccadeebradbury Never lose the joy of storytelling @RDee_Bradbury #biztransformation It all begins with hope... Goals / Vision + Pathways x Agency #rebeccadeebradbury #biztransformation It takes an intelligent person to deal with complexity. It takes an even more intelligent person to make that complexity simple. When people believe they can do it they do extraordinary things but sometimes, without realising it, we take that belief away. #leaders We judge others by their behaviours but we judge ourselves by our intent. Guess what, they do the same! #leadership #biztransformation The head's important but the heart's going to get you there. @RDee_Bradbury #biztransformation "We will always achieve more by inspiring hope not fear" @RDee_Bradbury #biztransformation "With ability is the responsibility to pass it forward."

Follow the 2016 Corden Lecture presented by Prof Frances Ruane LIVE from 7.00pm #corden16 #irisheconomy @BusEcoNews max corden introducing our speaker with belated st. Patrick's day celebrations  Welcome to our "unofficial St Patrick's Day Event" says Prof David Dickson #Corben16 #IrishEconomy  Ireland today: 4.6M people, 12% non-native born, well educated. Key sectors: ICT, medtech, pharma, food &amp; drink. #corden16 #irisheconomy History, crisis and economy recovery. The drivers and legacy challenges all being discussed by Professor Ruane.
#Corden16 #IrishEconomy Ruane: Ireland was in excellent fiscal shape, with low unemployment before the crisis. #corden16 #irisheconomy Tertiary education levels are at 50% in Ireland with an approximate 90% completion rate.
#Corden16 #IrishEconomy Ruane: Weak regulation, imprudent bank lending among the key elements in the Irish crisis. #corden16 #irisheconomy "We do dairy very well".....
#Corden16 #IrishEconomy 50% of Ireland's exports go to the USA.
#Corden16 #IrishEconomy Ruane: The Irish recovery has been faster and more pronounced than that of Greece, Spain and Portugal. #corden16 #irisheconomy Government policies adversely affected economic growth rates between 1980-1985. 
#Corden16 #IrishEconomy Pre-crash Ireland's loan to deposit ratio was stable. By joining the Euro they were able to gain access to low credit for the first time. Lessons for EU countries in crisis: focus on jobs and distribution, manage public expectations, provide vision #corden16 #irisheconomy Impact of Euro crash on interest rates saw Irish banks audit liquidity problems during the insolvency of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
#Corden16 During the crisis Ireland's GDP index recovered from downturn before Greece, Spain and Portugal. Exports were key to driving this growth. The Troika programme returned reputation lifting GDP line above -3. Ireland's economic legacy challenge. Taxation. Public expenditure cuts. Household mortgages in arrears.

Professor Ross Garnaut says @ChatibBasri is SE Asia's "best economist". #economicreform #Finch2016 Taking the stage: @ChatibBasri says labour market reform and the strengthening of regulations are critical to #economicreform. #Finch2016 Policy makers usually know what #economicreform they want to achieve, but don't know how to do go about it, says @ChatibBasri #Finch2016 International best practice #economicreform should work, but tends to fail in developing countries, says @ChatibBasri #Finch2016 Political and institutional structures limit best practice #economicreform in developing countries, says @ChatibBasri #Finch2016 Indonesia's "rainbow coalition" of politicians in Cabinet restricts #economicreform. But @ChatibBasri says political "sweeteners" can help. We have to sell our economic reforms to Cabinet, the President, the media and the public. Expert advice from @ChatibBasri #Finch2016 Publishing high quality information is the first step towards successful micro #economicreform, says @ChatibBasri Start with the smallest reforms that produce the highest marginal gains, says @ChatibBasri. Then turn these into success stories. #Finch2016 Expenditure reduction and expenditure switching policies drove stability over growth in Indonesia, @ChatibBasri says. #Finch2016 Without effective (and tough) #economicreform in 1998, Indonesia would have been in a serious fiscal crisis, says @ChatibBasri #Finch2016 Getting local media on board is crucial to achieving #economicreform, says @ChatibBasri #Finch2016 Adopting unpopular #economicreform policies in the short term is vital for long-term fiscal success, despite the political risks #Finch2016 Focusing on economic problems and being flexible on solutions is the key to successful #economicreform, says @ChatibBasri. #Finch2016 .@ChatibBasri's final advice: Find the best #economicreform solutions for the short-term, and use best practices in the long-term #Finch2016 Do social networking sites like #Facebook and @Twitter impede or encourage productivity? @TheAge Management Line http://www.theage.com.au/executive-style/management/blogs/management-line/the-antisocial-workplace-20110528-1f9f7.html¬†‚Ä¶ Treasury Management @GradSchBusEco Open Program running in Syd, Perth, Dar, Bris & Adel.

Join the convo here #mindsonmarkets Dean Paul Kofman starts our Minds on the Markets lecture by explaining the connection between neuroscience and business. #mindsonmarkets Introducing Read Montague, Prof Peter Bossaerts describes him as ‚Äòmodern day Leonardo Da Vinci‚Äô. #mindsonmarkets Read Montague: What does it mean to be a ‚Äòcomputational neuroscientist‚Äô? What is the relationship between brain and mind? #mindsonmarkets Our brain is highly efficient ‚Äì runs on about 23 watts (our whole body runs on about 85 watts). #mindsonmarkets Read Montague: Why is a chin on a clenched hand a symbol for ‚Äòthinking‚Äô? We often make deep inferences based on scant data. #mindsonmarkets Distinguishing ‚Äòbrain‚Äô from ‚Äòmind‚Äô: Read Montague talking through Alan Turing and computational theory of mind. #mindsonmarket The mind is the information processing supported by our brain. It‚Äôs like a computer program: Read Montague #mindsonmarkets The prevailing ambition is to describe mental activity as computations. Easy to say, but hard to do: Read Montague #mindsonmarkets Why do economics model provide a new perspective on the mind-brain problem? 1.

They extend beyond individuals: Montague #mindsonmarkets The market is a good experimental platform to examine the wisdom of crowds: Read Montague #mindsonmarkets Neuroscience lets us take healthy people and put them through fMRI machines and study what‚Äôs taking place in their brain. #mindsonmarkets Read Montague describing a multi-subject scan across several locations as subjects engage with a market game. #mindsonmarket Key feature: The fundamental value of the equity is flat and is transparent to subjects. Subjects feel the end of the market #mindsonmarkets What are their brains doing as they sense the market is overvalued? #mindsonmarkets Read Montague moving on to political ideology. Political ideology has large heritability components (rivalling height). #mindsonmarkets Read Montague: Can I take brain responses to emotionally evocative images and predict conservatism or liberalism? #mindsonmarkets The answer was a resounding yes: reaction to the first image was enough to make an accurate prediction 95% of the time. #mindsonmarkets Computational neuroscientists are training computers to play games at a level that beats human performance 85% of the time. #mindsonmarkets Read a profile of one of our alumni: Gloria Goh, Malaysia, BCom (Hons) 1982 http://bit.ly/jn3lm7 Will the new VET FEE HELP be regulated? @unimelb reviews the pros and cons of #studentloans  Looking forward to seeing the program for Melbourne Open House 2011.
