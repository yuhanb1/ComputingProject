On this episode of Eavesdrop on Experts, The @BostonGlobe's  Walter V Robinson explains why he's still optimistic about the future of #journalism. #UnimelbPursuit 🎧  Exercise advice is often an important part of physiotherapy treatment, but when patients walk in expecting a shoulder massage, how can clinics manage their expectations?

#UnimelbPursuit  Imagine you are a physiotherapist and a new patient, Brian, presents to you with shoulder pain. Brian has Type 2 diabetes, is inactive, obese and is not regularly seeing his diabetes educator. Your clinical knowledge tells you that his diabetes is likely to be poorly managed, which might explain his shoulder pain. As part of his ongoing shoulder management, you plan to give Brian some strategies to increase his physical activity levels, which you know will help manage his diabetes, in turn helping to manage his shoulder pain.

But Brian walked in expecting a shoulder massage. When the physio offers advice about exercise instead, it can be like finding raisins in a cookie when you were expecting chocolate chips: disappointing.

So how can physios motivate us to do more physical activity?

 @YaThinkN Paging @journalism_melb After months of debate, the @ASX dumped a proposal that would require companies to have a social licence to operate.

Prof Thomas Maak, Director @LeadingAtWork, argues it was wrong to do so.  Did you know more than 50,000 students attend the University of Melbourne each year? Our Vice-Chancellor, Professor Duncan Maskell, welcomed some of them at our Parkville campus as the new academic year began today.  As Indians prepare to vote in the general election, a campaign promise could bring wage equality to India's poorest people. How? With a minimum income guarantee program.

#UnimelbPursuit  Celebrating #ANZACDay with a drink is an established Australian tradition, but it hasn't always been so, and even today can sit uncomfortably.

#UnimelbPursuit  As we approach #AnzacDay, we look at how sharing food during a time of war, even across enemy lines, is a potent symbol of our humanity →  Our Regiment will continue its longstanding tradition of holding an Anzac Day Dawn Service at our Parkville campus.

#UnimelbPursuit #AnzacDay  Our Regiment continued its longstanding tradition of holding an #AnzacDay Dawn Service on campus at the Cenotaph this morning. This year, Vice-Chancellor Professor Duncan Maskell laid a wreath to pay tribute and reflect on lives lost, or changed forever, by war.  When you think of war, you'd be forgiven for not thinking of accountants. Here's their war story.

#UnimelbPursuit @BusEcoNews  By the late 1920s, #AnzacDay had become male-centric. In fact, literature exploring the representation of women in Anzac Day practice and mythology is generally lacking. But was Anzac Day just for the boys? Definitely not.

 Today is #NationalSorryDay. On the eve of #ReconciliationWeek we commemorate the 1997 ‘Bringing Them Home’ report &amp; remember the grief, suffering &amp; injustice experienced by the stolen generations. The theme of this year’s @RecAustralia Week is ‘grounded in truth, walk together with courage’. In this #UnimelbPursuit article Dr Lyndon Ormond-Parker outlines some of the initiatives and policies in 2019 taking a step in the right direction:  Melbourne is undergoing a once-in-a-generation transformation and Indigenous placemaking in design is gaining greater currency. Our projects, including the New Student Precinct, are helping lead the way.

The system is more stable now, are you still having trouble? @mango_tango10 Hi Anice, Depending on the subject, it can take until classes start for LMS to be opened. It's up to each subject coordinator @ChristineMTodd Hi Christine. Law registers JD students so you get a cohort & networking experience.

If so, this can be sorted by going to Academic Advice Day on 16 Feb. @signorina_julia Hi Julia,you need to enrol in subjects by your enrolment lapse date (which varies),but you have until week 2 to change them @DoTheWoo Hi Bambi, you're best off contacting the VCA or 13 MELB (13 6352) @signorina_julia Hi Julia, depending on the degree, we can often extend it for you.

It has been done. But it will be a question for the two graduate schools to agree on. @acaderama my pleasure - good luck @acaderama of course :D @acaderama thanks, by the way.

Glad you love Melbourne too :) @trentho Hi Trent, what's the issue you're having?  Perhaps I can help point you in the right direction. Sir Paul will speak on how good scientific advice can be shared, and the best decisions made #paulnurse Discoveries in science, industry are part of an ecosystem: we don’t discover without peripheral vision and in-depth knowledge #paulnurse But the key to all good science is freedom - to think, work and discover #paulnurse Contentious? #paulnurse believes decisions about research funding must take into account the researchers who’ll do the work @SilentHamish magnets!  How do they work? #sciencequestions RT @reneewebs: Earmarking a particular area for research may result in poor quality science, chasing the money #paulnurse” @is_chris tickets went very fast.  There, there. Research leaders should work to inspire, not make fences around their areas of interest: in other words, they must lead #paulnurse Sir #paulnurse suggests we could try science parties in the style of the Lunar Society. Room is full of scientist giggles #excellentsound Sir #paulnurse almost all scientists agree climate change has, will lead to temperature change. Outliers cherry pick data A confidently stated error can convince more than tentative, good science: keep politics away from science #paulnurse RT @reneewebs: There is a failure on the part of scientists in neglecting to engage and listen to the concerns of the public #paulnurse Huge applause for #paulnurse , a great scientist and a lovely speaker.  Here endeth our tweets: click the hashtag for the full conversation. @dr_krystal thank you for tweeting tonight!  Much appreciated :) @Knives_Chang We hope you’ll be happy here!

Historically speaking it tends to be up and running by around 10, but it varies. @swtpol we can't give an exact time - historically speaking it tends to be up and running by around 10. @BastianSimrajh turns out we can't give an exact time - historically speaking it tends to be up and running by around 10. . @maramiscosmic Since you put it like that @dilarayilmaz013, DM us your address and we'll send you one. @BastianSimrajh Cheers!  Hope you get great classes. @JrodMac92 @SophiaBeckett1 @agirlnamedally That is the plan.  It's actually pretty nice, we had a play with it recently. @clairee_bare It would be super if you didn't fight the other students to the death, though - ta :) @BastianSimrajh We're doing final testing with a small group of students  - so it depends on whether changes need to be made. @alice__xox Hmm, not sure.  If @SciMelb don't have any hints (?), 13MELB may be able to help. @alice__xox @MDHS_SC Apologies Alice - we're heard back that the team is working to fix this subject.

Thanks @zulzulzul Free event - 'sold out' should read 'snapped up' really. @mollyfud Sadly we can't live stream tonight.  We'll try to share as much as we can on Twitter!  #timbl @charliesome @timberners_lee All the cool kids are #timbl @carh88 geeks and nerds ftw! #timbl @chakko #timbl :) @emgemjay welcome! Sir Tim is on stage: asking how we decide what to trust. Does web searching fulfil that need? #timbl About 99% of the audience has written a computer program at least once :) #timbl When you link to something, you recommend it. The more links, the better the recommendation. You are the internet’s quality control! #timbl That is the “social contract” of the web.  #timbl @jimboot :( @sheenacampbell two hashtags!  Oh noes :( MT @Lizzie_OShea: Look at social media systems, go and imagine different ones - TBL's message to this abundance of coders” #timbl @jazzrozz #timbl :) @IMBASEorg he does seem to think very fast! Sir Tim: “Aaron was a great guy” who will be missed.  Would want the world to talk about open data. #timbl @yodaberg hence we are retweeting as well as tweeting!  He’s a fast thinker :) Sir Tim:  “It is no longer OK to be in politics and not know how the Internet works”  #timbl @kornys thanks for the link :) @thebreg oh, we are.  #nerdlife MT “@foxwisp: #timbl What would Tim change about HTML/HTTP?  Unified parsers, no //, reverse domain order..using web:  but these will come” @sunnyhall @yodaberg @Asher_Wolf @loupardi our new goal: to Tweet as fast as TBL thinks.  Amazing. Sir Tim closes by speaking of a “new momentum for open”. Why not learn to code & make something to share? Thank you @timberners_lee #timbl @loupardi @sunnyhall @yodaberg @Asher_Wolf phew!  That was amazing.  Now for a nice cup of tea and a sit down. @deylanka @timberners_lee @unilibrary thank you for coming along! @chris_bloke yes, on reflection about 90%?  There was some very fast typing going on to (sort of) match Sir Tim’s pace! @tsid we were tweeting live and quoting, rather than making our own statements about the Internet. Good point, people do - for arguments etc @smithpick Right.  9am, library, carrel.  Thesis. Or the puppy gets it. @tsid absolutely. Yes, so much more could have been discussed and argued.    Sign of a good lecture. @Coal_story Hi Andy, we don't have any logged errors with that subject - what's the problem and we can report back? @Coal_story Thanks Andy, we'll follow this up.

Questions welcome via #uomfoi And last but not least, Jerril Rechter, CEO of VicHealth & Dr. @louise_schaper , CEO of the Health Informatics Society of Australia #uomfoi We'll also be joined by Andrew Cuthbertson, Chief Scientist, Head of R&D at CSL; David Karoly, Prof. of Atmospheric Science #uomfoi ... On our #uomfoi panel tonight: @normanswan , producer and presenter of the ABC Health Report and Tonic Full house tonight for #uomfoi - we’re looking forward to hearing your opinions and questions. For those at home, a live stream is up now: http://ideas.unimelb.edu.au/  #uomfoi Generous welcome to the event from @GlynDavisVC .  We hope you will be part of the Festival of Ideas this year. Cr. Jackie Watts says there is no better place in Australia than Melbourne, to talk about ideas.  What are yours? #uomfoi Chair @normanswan says turning scientific evidence into action can take years. We aim to close that gap. #uomfoi . @normanswan : we know that climate change is real. How can we translate that knowledge into democratic action? #uomfoi . @normanswan : please share your tweets, they will form part of our discussion tonight. #uomfoi Pleas welcome @louise_schaper : *organised* knowledge is power. Technology leads us to the democratisation of knowledge #uomfoi . @louise_schaper : we still organise  health information in a very basic and slow way. Can take 18 years to implement discoveries #uomfoi . @epatientdave used social media to source and manage information about his diagnosis - would you? #uomfoi . @louise_schaper : a recent study shows most doctors don’t want patients to access their own records. #uomfoi Pleas welcome Andrew Cuthbertson, head scientist and head of R&D at CSL. #uomfoi AC: making data available is in public interest but patient level data must be handled w. care - eg w. rare, identifiable conditions #uomfoi . AC: privately held clinical data should be made available to legitimate researchers - who can demonstrate respect and integrity #uomfoi . AC : would like to see all medical students train in biostatistics - do you agree? Or is the medical curriculum full enough? #uomfoi Please welcome David Karoly, Professor of Atmospheric Science : Climate change is something we’ve known about for over 110 years. #uomfoi DK:  it is easier to fight the science than fight the problem of climate change #uomfoi ‘Great is the power of steady misrepresentation : but the history of science shows that … this power does not long endure' - Darwin #uomfoi DK: Darwin was an optimist!  We need the support of everyone to effect change. #uomfoi Please welcome Jerril Rechter, CEO Vic Health. #uomfoi JR: you are only one email away from 39% of the world’s population. Smartphone use only dips at dinnertime! #uomfoi JR: today anyone can add to world’s knowledge on health issues.  But the world only cares about what you can *do* with knowledge #uomfoi JR: we can now reach people who were once remote using social media, and they can help us build data banks #uomfoi JR: we need to kick start conversations and provide ppl with tools to actively collaborate. #uomfoi That concludes our presentations. @normanswan asks questions of our panel with iPad at hand - what would you ask the panel? #uomfoi DK : all politicians talk about climate change.  Haven’t had a chance to debate with TA yet though! #uomfoi Question: why do climate scientists hedge so much? It can seem weak. #uomfoi DK: we don’t equivocate on what we know.  #uomfoi DK: one of the difficulties is that climate scientists make data totally available, it can be manipulated  #uomfoi LS: we need to create data literacy #uomfoi Question from a psychologist: what can we do to change systems when we work with individuals? We need marketers! #uomfoi DK: Yes, we need people who are much better communicators than we climate scientists! #uomfoi “@bzeager: Freedom of speech and data allows me to join this conversation from the crowd #uomfoi” Question: where is the tension b/w scientific credibility and good marketing?  Why not relax strictures and work together?  #uomfoi NS: some scientists do this really well!  Maybe too well - some treatments are far over-promoted. #uomfoi NS: the tension is perhaps between non- commercially oriented science and marketing.  #uomfoi Question to whole panel: if you had the evidence for climate change, how would you promote this in your field #uomfoi JR: we struggle with similar issues: it’s hard to get the word out #uomfoi LS: we can use crowd sourcing and creative solutions to get around a lot of our budget problems #uomfoi NS: surely the public health record should be designed between the public and health professionals? #uomfoi LS: yes!  We had so little time, marketing, budget.  We would love to do more #uomfoi Question : since you have the data,  what would you do with it? #uomfoi NS: who is going to police this? #uomfoi AC: the future as I see it is public access. First step will be investigative access in Europe #uomfoi DK : the first step has to be increased literacy eg medical, scientific literacy. And then the community has to read critically! #uomfoi Question for LS: uptake of public health record access is poor.  Why not use opt-out? #uomfoi LS: there was a lot of discussion about that. We saw fear of ‘privacy creep’. It’s disappointing #uomfoi JR: we can educate them to be literate and discerning, and really involve them in debate - Vic Health is working on this! #uomfoi Question: how do you keep your good humour in the face of all this? This is a catastrophic failure of democracy! #uomfoi DK: we haven’t found a better way… it will be community that determines how fast we turn around. It’s not someone else’s problem. #uomfoi Voting time! Join the poll - which of our speakers’ propositions was most persuasive? http://Pollev.com/uomfestival  #uomfoi Crowd are loving live action voting!  Who will win?  #uomfoi Crowd says that climate change is the most persuasive argument: we need to work together to effect change. #uomfoi Thank you all for your participation,

'Feeding 10 Billion People and Sustaining The Planet' starts soon! Join the twitter conversation #uomfoi Livestream: http://ow.ly/prvKK  Richard Roush opens the first Food + Nutrition session, "to feed our growing population the world will need to produce 70% more" #uomfoi Fiona Stanley now takes the stage for a Festival welcome, "think about it, challenge it, tweet it!" #uomfoi Prem Bhalla is our first speaker, "our world started to change 10,000 years ago... we started to build huts, villages, societies" #uomfoi Prem Bhalla: Without the innovation of fertiliser our population would be half of what it is now! #uomfoi Prem Bhalla: "In the next 40 years we need to produce more food than we ever have in the entire human history" #uomfoi How is climate change impacting our food? Prem Bhalla argues that as our Earth gets warmer, our crop yields are reducing. #uomfoi PB: "At this minute we have enough food to feed 7 billion, but we have 1 billion who go to bed with empty stomachs" #uomfoi Prem Bhalla ends by arguing that food production is not enough. We need an equitable system so food is affordable & accessible #uomfoi Agnes Richroch (@aricroch) now takes the stage! #uomfoi .@aricroch: "From now to mid century there will be 34% increase in people... world is warmer, humans are behind most of the warming" #uomfoi .@aricroch: "decreasing pesticides & fertiliser in agriculture could have a positive effect to health, wellbeing of ecosystem" #uomfoi .@aricroch argues that genetically modified crop yields can help us achieve a cleaner and more sustainable environment #uomfoi How about nutrition? @aricroch contends that genetically modified food can also improve nutrition - with Omega-3 as a key example. #uomfoi .@aricroch: "We need to discover new genes, new biotechnology... to end hunger, increase crop yield without harming environment" #uomfoi Peter Gresshoff takes the stage: Should we be feeding our cars or people? #uomfoi Peter Gresshoff: "Food and biofuel come from the same source, more or less" #uomfoi Peter Gresshoff: "There is no argument. We must use biofuel... because it's sustainable" #uomfoi Peter Gresshoff: "There is a usage issue... We only have 40 years of oil left" #uomfoi Peter Gresshoff states that we need something sustainable "The bottom line is that we are going to run out of oil" #uomfoi Peter Gresshoff offers an example, "these legumes don't require nitrogen fertilisers, they are extremely sustainable for production" #uomfoi Peter Gresshoff: "with present knowledge & materials... we can yield 5000 litres per hectare" on sustainable biofuel #uomfoi PG concludes: "we are translating knowledge from other areas into biofuel in order to make advancements and start a new industry" #uomfoi Welcome to the stage "Environmental Messenger" Simran Sethi (@simransethi) #uomfoi .@simransethi starts by saying that we've been told "to make more food by any means necessary... consider a new story" #uomfoi .@simransethi: "How do we feed a hungry planet? We already do, or rather, we already can" #uomfoi So why are people still hungry? @simransethi "availability does not equal access" #uomfoi .@simransethi: "The largest food growing people, peasant farmers, are too poor to buy food" #uomfoi .@simransethi questions, "What happens to your diet and budget when the price of food goes up?" Food is wasted on fuel & feed #uomfoi .@simransethi: "access to feed people need to consider the source of food as well as distribution and waste" #uomfoi .@simransethi: "One of the smartest thing we can do is to stop eating animals" #uomfoi .@simransethi: "It's not just what we grow, but how we grow it... not what we raise, but how we raise it" #uomfoi .@simransethi: "Sustainable way of feeding 7 to 10 billion people... a diversified ecosystem.. tending to soil.. conserving water" #uomfoi .@simransethi: "solutions to these problems belong to everyone of us... reconsider our relationship to our ecosystem" #uomfoi .@simransethi concludes by reminding the audience that we must also consider the redistribution of power & wealth #uomfoi Garry Egger is up next! #uomfoi GE: "We can't just look at a cause of a disease, we need to look at the cause of the cause of the disease... the distal cause" #uomfoi GE: "Not a disease... I think obesity is a risk factor, a signal, a canary in the mineshaft, that something is wrong in our society" #uomfoi Buy a new car? Garry Egger: "consumption is leading people to become obese... are we interested in economy or wellbeing of people?" #uomfoi Garry Egger: "introducing public funding of election campaigns if we want any effect on obesity" & stop the lobbying. #uomfoi We now have all panelists join the stage for a lively Q&A. Use #uomfoi for those burning questions! Q: Warmer temperatures better for food growth? #uomfoi A: @simransethi argues that while some plants may grow better, as do weeds & pests. Need to think of the bigger picture. #uomfoi .@simransethi "top 10 commercial seed companies own 73% of the market share... We need to know where our food comes from" #uomfoi Richard Roush contends that perhaps the greater pressure is not at the seed level, but rather at the retail level. #uomfoi Q: GM research in plants to reduce burden of cancer? #uomfoi A: Garry Egger "Fine point but tackling problem the wrong way... need to think of the distal cause" #uomfoi @micheob Thank you! We hope you're enjoying the Festival of Ideas :) Q: Safety in GM foods? A: @aricroch refutes claims of non-safety. Many studies have proved the viability of GM crops/foods. #uomfoi Q: Extent are people aware of environment degradation? A @simransethi "we all have a vested interest... there's not one solution" #uomfoi Time for the poll! Click here & decide which proposition connected with you most: http://ow.ly/prCfv  #uomfoi That ends this session of "Feeding 10 Billion People and Sustaining the Planet" - thanks to all who joined in the conversation! #uomfoi Hope you enjoyed!

Why aren't you all following @uom_ideas? #ff First up Jeanette Tamplin & Lucy O'Grady conduct a quick scientific experiment with the audience #uomfoi We will be live tweeting today's first session "Is Democracy Working?", the livestream starts now at: http://ideas.unimelb.edu.au  #uomfoi First up is ABC Managing Director @abcmarkscott #uomfoi . @abcmarkscott: "the news is in an era of revolution and transformation" #uomfoi . @abcmarkscott: "I'm an optimist about the future of democracy in the world of digital media" #uomfoi . @abcmarkscott: "the news is available any time, anywhere, any place, on any device" #uomfoi . @abcmarkscott says political debate needs both Aristotle's Analytics & Rhetoric, "the path of designing alternate futures" #uomfoi . @abcmarkscott: "the audience asks different questions than the gallery asks… and that's a good thing" #uomfoi @abcmarkscott  says more than 1.3M people completed the ABC's Vote Compass survey showing the public want to play an increasing role #uomfoi . @abcmarkscott concludes he doesn't think it was the good old days "when a handful decided what you could watch & where & when" #uomfoi . @timsout says he wasn't drawn to political philosophy by rationality but rather a desire to tackle racism #uomfoi . @timsout: "we can't leave decisions to reason alone" #uomfoi . @timsout: we should be proud that 45% of Australians were born overseas or are the children of migrants, it's a "social miracle" #uomfoi . @timsout: "from the research we know that 20% of Australians have experienced race-hate talk" #uomfoi . @timsout: "it's not about facts, it's about our moral standing as a society" #uomfoi TS: we should tackle racism with patriotic appeal, "if you love your country you should be prepared to work to improve your country" #uomfoi Lawrence Gostin begins that he thinks inequality is "corrosive to society" #uomfoi LG: "the top 20% of the American population own 80% of the wealth in the United States" #uomfoi LG: "the US is more unequal in its income distribution than Namibia… Nicaragua, Cuba" #uomfoi LG says that the polling in the US shows most people are misinformed & think they have fairly equal incomes #uomfoi LG: The Social Mobility Myth "if you are born poor, it is likely you will stay poor" #uomfoi LG says that the health gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is 16-17 yrs. Larger than in the US, Canada or NZ #uomfoi LG: "good governance is not elections. It is stewardship, transparency" #uomfoi LG concludes with some simple math, "democracy + equality = justice" #uomfoi Speaking now Jane Smith, director of @MADEBallarat #uomfoi JS says there are 1.2M Australians unregistered to vote, 46% under 30 years of age #uomfoi JS: Millennials make up 30% of Australia, Baby Boomers are only 20% #uomfoi JS says that most people who fought at the Eureka Stockade over the price of a gold license were under 25 #uomfoi JS: "84% of Milennials believe that they have the potential to change the world" #uomfoi If you're u30 & think you're the voice of your generation get involved in @MADEBallarat's Movement campaign: http://ow.ly/px7s6  #uomfoi JS concludes with her proposition that we should use a Millennial leader to increase democratic participation of under 30s #uomfoi . Government_UoM Prof Helen Sullivan's proposition is "we must innovate to build a democratic system that works for all our citizens"... HS: "we have outgrown our representative system" #uomfoi HS: "I'm not saying we have to do away with representative democracy all together… it's the institutions that need to change" #uomfoi HS advocates a shift from representative to participatory democracy #uomfoi HS: "the act of participation, in itself, is edifying" #uomfoi HS: participatory democracies accept that "individuals may be the experts in their own lives" #uomfoi Those interested in strong vs thin democracy debate mentioned by HS, @BenjaminRBarber's "Strong Democracy" offers good introduction #uomfoi HS concludes "we need to make sure that the setting is right and the resources are available" #uomfoi The speakers will now discuss the ideal future for Australia's democracy and how we get there #uomfoi . @abcmarkscott: tools need to be created so politicians can have an "ongoing dialogue around substantive issues" with the nation #uomfoi Q: What if a participatory democracy votes for re-introduction of capital punishment? #uomfoi A: HS says that frequent argument against participatory democracy is "we can't trust the public to make the right decision" #uomfoi A: HS says when setting up participatory democracy we need to ask ourselves if we can't be trusted to make right decision sometimes #uomfoi TS: "our liberal democracy is about ethos just as much as it's about process" #uomfoi Q: Who are the public and how can we trust them to make the right decision, particularly on complex scientific questions? #uomfoi A: MS says tools that enable richer political discourse will enable us to have "more sophisticated and educated engagement" #uomfoi Q: How do we ensure there are no vested interests and no one is made worse off by policy change? #uomfoi A: JS "we've lost sight of talking about values… because it's been about economics" #uomfoi A: LG says "what we're expecting of democracy is far too much" because it is a messy process #uomfoi A: HS counters that "we don't ask enough of democracy" #uomfoi A: HS says for everyone who uses social media for celebrity watching there are many who use it for incredible things #uomfoi . @annarose discusses the 'Filter Bubble' - that we only see what we are interested or believe in when we go online #uomfoi Q: What are your thoughts on introducing Swiss style direct democracy to Australia? #uomfoi A: @timsout says that citizen-led reform works well within small populations, especially when it fits into the political culture #uomfoi A: @timsout "I don't think my fellow members of Gen-Y are going to have the patience" for decade-long political debate #uomfoi Q: Is democracy only for the wealthy in our society? #uomfoi A: HS says that she rejects that democracy is only for the middle class #uomfoi A: @timsout suggests we need to look more broadly, esp to SE Asia, for innovations in democracy #uomfoi A: @abcmarkscott says technology enables the voice of the public "to aggregate and be heard" over those of vested interests #uomfoi Q: How can we ensure that politicians make decision that reflect public opinion rather than their own beliefs? #uomfoi A: HS says we need "to augment representative democracy & the role of politicians" #uomfoi A: LG says we need to ask 'why would a politician vote against public opinion?' because they aren't accountable to the public #uomfoi Join the audience and vote for the proposition that you identify with most strongly: http://ow.ly/px8Wg  #uomfoi Q: Do the structural mechanisms of our democracy make short-termism inevitable? #uomfoi A: JS says she believes democracy will transition to being more issues-based and that more parties will form around certain issues #uomfoi Q: How do you engage young people beyond just making comment? #uomfoi A: JS says the Millennials have a more global focus and will be motivated to engage if they feel that they are being listened to #uomfoi A: @timsout says that we need to focus on the civic good and how single issues fit into the bigger picture #uomfoi The results are in! @timsout's proposition that 'we must argue with emotion as well as with evidence' has the strongest response #uomfoi Thanks everyone for joining the lively debate on the future of our democracy. 'Democracy: The Solutions' begins at 12:30pm #uomfoi Our next session ‘Democracy: The Solutions’ will be live tweeted from the @uom_ideas account #uomfoi Good morning!

• Week commencing: Monday 16 April 
Overhead electrical cables will be removed in Barry and Grattan streets. Note: This work includes saw cutting and excavation and will generate medium to high levels of noise and require intermittent closures of footpaths. • Week commencing: Monday 23 April 
A covered pedestrian walkway will be installed on Grattan Street outside the Alan Gilbert building and the Peter Doherty Institute. These are scheduled to be installed from 23 April to 11 May... ...These will restrict movement and will cause minor inconvenience in busy periods.

Students and staff at the Parkville campus are no doubt aware of the ongoing works taking place for the exciting Metro Tunnel Project on Grattan St.pic.twitter.com/VO6NuMXiQl Below are some important updates to the project that may affect your transit and access to walkways/buildings in the coming weeks. In coming days, the Grattan St entrance of the Alan Gilbert Building will be closed for the construction of covered walkways. To enter the building during this period, please use the Barry St entrance to avoid inconvenience. In early May, the Grattan St entrance of the Peter Doherty Institute will also be closed for the construction of covered walkways. In addition to the building entrance, the bicycle storage area of this building will also be closed. To enter the building during this period, please use the Elizabeth or Berkeley St entrances. The installation of these walkways is an important safety measure for your protection, as large equipment (drilling rigs and cranes) are arriving on site in the coming weeks. It’s important to note that the covered walkways will be much narrower than the current footpath. This may result in occasional pedestrian congestion during busy times of the day. Cyclists should also dismount and walk their bicycles when moving through these covered areas.

But the good news doesn’t come without a bit of inconvenience. Construction of the first stage of the University Square Master Plan will start in May 2018, with a planned completion date of February 2019. What does this mean for you? Unfortunately, much of University Square will be closed during construction. As construction gradually completes, sections will be re-opened starting with a new Leicester Street footpath. Pedestrians won’t have access to large sections of the square during early construction works but will still have access to footpaths on Leicester Street and Barry Street for north-south movements.

Congratulations to Prof Geoff Burnstock, awarded the Macfarlane Burnett Medal! The medal recognises scientific research of the highest standing in the biological sciences  Prof Burnstock, who was elected as a Fellow of the Academy 1971, is internationally recognised for the discovery of purinergic neurotransmission, a novel signalling system between cells that is of central importance for many biological processes. His 1972 discovery challenged established concepts of the biology of cell messengers and neurotransmission. The purinergic concept was not accepted by the scientific community, and it took 20 years for Prof Burnstock to prove his hypothesis: Heads up!
