Research alone is not enough. 95% of biotech startups fail. Running a lab and a biotech company are two different things #UnimelbSBS  "Ask yourself: what made you start your career in biomedical research? [...] Is this all about greed and money? There is an underlying higher regard for research. [...] Stop the research we need to begin developing it." - Dr Lynn Johnson Langer (@JohnsHopkins, USA)  Partnerships with industry are the key to developing relevant subjects and the evolution of new degrees. "We need a diverse student body, a diverse way of thinking..." – Dr Lynn Johnson Langer (@JohnsHopkins, USA) #UnimelbSBS  "By taking this Enterprise Specialisation, at the very least you'll understand the vocabulary, the way of thinking, working under very strict milestones"–Dr Lynn Johnson Langer (@JohnsHopkins, USA) #UnimelbSBS Go beyond 'what' your research will be: 'how can I make a difference?'  Final: "The industry's responsibility is to stay connected to educators" – Dr Lynn Johnson Langer (@JohnsHopkins, USA) Success ensured when we: continuously learn and adapt to permanent whitewater, listen to experts and include diversity of opinions in decision making #UnimelbSBS  Launch day for our new Master of Biomedical Science, Enterprise Specialisation, is well underway!

Meet our panel: Dr Lynn Johnson Langer (@JohnsHopkins, USA), Prof Andrew Cuthbertson, Dr C. Glenn Begley, Mr Andrew Wear, Prof Fabienne Mackay and Dr Shane Huntington...  Prof Andrew Cuthbertson (@csl) // The Enterprise Specialisation combines entrepreneurship and a structured biomedical course and gives students an opportunity to diversify their skills in a formal and immensely rewarding way. #UnimelbSBS  Mr Andrew Wear (@AndrewWear) //  We need to move beyond translational research to create a vibrant commercial job market. We need people who understand the commercialisation process and drug development pathways. #UnimelbSBS  Prof Fabienne Mackay // There has been a culture shift. Success is no longer an individual journey but a team journey.
Dr C. Glenn Begley // 16 years of industry have made two things apparent: 1. it is absolutely crucial to be part of a team 2. flexibility is vital. #UnimelbSBS  Dr C. Glenn Begley (@Biocurate) // Biotech startups are high risk ventures with a high failure rate. We have the commercial knowledge. It is reasonable to fail because of a lack of scientific knowledge, but not because of a lack of commercial knowledge. #UnimelbSBS  Prof Fabienne Mackay // We need to rework how we think about PhDs. It's important to have a broader view of what a PhD is, so that students can make more informed decisions about where it can take them. #UnimelbSBS  Dr C. Glenn Begley // False idea of demarcations. You can't be a clinician without understanding translational processes...
Dr Lynn Johnson Langer (@JohnsHopkins, USA) // Entrepreneurial ventures can enhance your academic potential. #UnimelbSBS  Final: Dr Lynn Johnson Langer (@JohnsHopkins, USA) // Learn the vocabulary of science and business. Commercialisation of science is critical. You're at a strong global disadvantage if you don't take up this opportunity.

We’re covering the program including Roy’s collaborators &amp; protegees from around the globe as the reveal the latest in their fight against infectious diseases.  After 36 years, Roy’s taught more than 15,000 @UniMelbMDHS microbiology students. He’s a global authority on E. coli &amp; leader @TheDohertyInst, @MCRI_for_kids &amp; @ASMicrobiology. Yet, Roy says his most elegant work may still be ahead #UnimelbSBS  He’s co-authored more than 300 peer-reviewed papers &amp; together with his collaborators, received &gt;$35million in competitive grant funding. Roy’s research also resulted in a commercial anti-ETEC antibody-based product, Travelan #UnimelbSBS  Prof Myron Levine @UMmedschool (USA), has dedicated his career to working in developing countries on the epidemiology, treatment &amp; prevention of infectious diseases. He’s here to discuss the Global Enteric Multicenter Study and a vaccine to help fight E. coli  #UnimelbSBS  After a 40-year intellectual bond with Roy, Myron says: “During a period in Australia when enterohaemorrhagic E. coli was responsible for severe, sometimes fatal, haemolytic uraemic syndrome in young children, Roy was the Australian expert on this pathogen.” #UnimelbSBS  Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) – funded by Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to investigate pathogens that cause diarrhoeal burden with the aim of saving lives of children in the developing world. #UnimelbSBS  Myron: “I was fascinated by the bacteriology that was done &amp; fascinated by the fact that there was hardly any pathogens to look at" By collecting 500,00 child-years worth of data, GEMS revealed that on the contrary pathogens are significantly associated with diarrhoea #UnimelbSBS  GEMS: ETEC/Shigella vaccines targeting tourists open up a promising cash market that can help children suffering from mild-to-severe diarrhoea #UnimelbSBS  From GEMS: There are two steps to pathogenesis of ETEC: 1. Attachment to receptors on the enterocytes 2. Expression of enterotoxins, resulting in diarrhoea #UnimelbSBS  Key GEMS outcome: clinical studies planned for CVD Shigella-ETEC vaccines. It takes a “global village" to complete a study like the GEMS. Thank you to Prof Myron (Mike) Levine for his warm presentation on GEMS –“Roy, you’ve been a fantastic friend and colleague" #UnimelbSBS  Final words from Myron as he wraps up his Q&amp;A – it's been a wonderful ride! #UnimelbSBS  Prof Roy Robins-Browne’s collaborators &amp; protegees gather at his Retirement Symposium after 36 years at #UnimelbSBS  Dr Danielle Ingle, Roy’s recent PhD student, now a Postdoctoral Fellow in Genomic Epidemiology @ANUMedSchool discusses Mining GEMS. Roy told #UnimelbSBS he’s learned much about ‘new age’ microbiology from Danielle. Read:  "The legend lives in every mention of e coli" – Quick intermissions: some lovely comments from the community for Roy  #UnimelbSBS  Danielle channels Roy to begin her presentation: "Let me tell you a story..." –Reflections on her "holistic" PhD experience with Roy #UnimelbSBS  Danielle’s PhD Q: “What is aEPEC?” A: 1. aEPEC isn’t a single homogenous group 2. aEPEC are globally disseminated; aEPEC persist in different ecological environments 3. 30 main lineages of LEE pathogenicity islands; these are often acquired once and then maintained #UnimelbSBS  Danielle recounts Roy's reaction to her mistake that "felt like the end of the world, spoke volumes about the type of scientist &amp; man that [he] is" – 'I'm really proud that you [Danielle] told me [Roy], it makes me respect you more" #UnimelbSBS  GEMS' aEPEC collection provided a unique opportunity to look at antimicrobial resistance (AMR); 65% isolates had AMR #UnimelbSBS  Danielle's closing words: "I want to say thank you on behalf of all the students who have come through – thank you for inspiring us." #UnimelbSBS  Pneumococcal vaccines in the Asia Pacific is an important topic – their use can prevent some cases of pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. A/Prof Catherine Satzke @CSatzke of @MCRI_for_Kids, a former student of Roy’s, discusses the latest #UnimelbSBS  Catherine on pneumococcal carriage: carriage is a prerequisite for disease. Reduce carriage = reduce disease. We can measure pneumococcal vaccines through carriage. This may be the only way to monitor vaccine impact in low-income settings. #UnimelbSBS  “Most of you are familiar with Roy’s contribution to the department…I think Roy is amazing at realising where you might want to go in your career before you do…He helped you without even knowing it.” #UnimelbSBS  Danielle: "Roy is one of the few individuals transition between supervisor, mentor and collaborator...an exemplar for how to care for your team... I'm very proud to be here as an ex-member of the RRB lab. Thank you very much Roy." #UnimelbSBS  “Roy is a gentleman scientist,” says Prof Paul Johnson @Austin_Health, who did his PhD with Roy in the mid-1990s. “He is brilliant in his field, broadly interested in the world, ethical to a fault and a lovely human being.” #UnimelbSBS  Paul on a PCR for Buruli ulcer: the mode of transmission &amp; reservoir for Buruli ulcer are still contested . Buruli ulcer also in Australia #UnimelbSBS  Presence of mycolactone toxin colours Buruli ulcer with its aggressive expression, killing tissue and suppressing immune response #UnimelbSBS  Let's PCR this... Strong statistic: PCR positivity related to Buruli ulcer (M. ulcerans) #UnimelbSBS  Paul's closing thank you: "Roy, the time we spent together was a pleasure."  #UnimelbSBS  After years of research into E. coli and other friends, Prof Elizabeth Hartland @ProfHartland (@Hudson_Research) shares her take on what’s ahead for the fight against these infectious diseases #UnimelbSBS  Liz's PhD work on the genetic basis of virulence in Yersinia entercolitica looked specifically at its host pathogen interactions. #UnimelbSBS  ...Liz then moved on to work on E. Coli. We know that EPEC suppresses inflammatory response and inhibits death receptor signalling. #UnimelbSBS  Liz: “It’s a pleasure to be here, and slightly surreal. I’ve known Roy for about 30 years…he’s always been there…I’ll be forever grateful of his unwavering support of me…He’s been such an advocate and has such a passion for research. Thank you Roy.” #UnimelbSBS  Photo highlight: Roy with Myron (Mike) #UnimelbSBS  Photo highlight: Roy with Danielle #UnimelbSBS  Photo highlight: Roy with Catherine #UnimelbSBS  Photo highlight: Roy with Paul #UnimelbSBS  Photo highlight: Roy with Liz #UnimelbSBS  …and that’s a wrap!

A: We must get the science right. As with the AIDS epidemic, all policies and strategies must be evidence-based The Lancet sees climate change as a global health issue - strong evidence in support of that view #kirbylecture Your place of birth should not determine whether or not you can access drugs that preserve life and human dignity, says @HonMichaelKirby Take away - we must look afresh at HIV and the law, with a strong focus on the universal human right to access essential health care (And this is not reflected in current patent, drug technology and intellectual property law) That's a wrap for the Nossal Institute #kirbylecture on global health and human rights - big ideas and a compelling discussion #AIDS2014 Beyond the tremor: @upclosepodcast looks at how genetic technologies affect diagnosis & treatment of Parkinson's http://bit.ly/1p3KjFA  Prof Cameron Simmons tells @BloombergTV that #Ebola outbreak is unlikely to spread beyond West Africa http://bit.ly/1kgwByM   via @uommedia A big congratulations to the FREO2 team at @unimelb who have been shortlisted for the @eurekaprizes for Innovative Use of Technology! @WISMAE21 We hope so too.

Same as it did in the 19th C, says Peter Hutton #21Ced Can we change the paradigm of education and allow students to take control of their education? #21Ced The future: creative thinking & entrepreneurship, increased teacher risk taking, visibly active learning, learning centers #21Ced iPads in the classroom - teaching aid or destructive distraction?

A recurrent affective (mood) disorder involving both mania and depression #publiclecture Mania & melancholia were recognised in the early stages of scientific medicine by Hippocrates #publiclecture Kraepelin's affective states continuum (1899) was very similar to what we call bipolar disorder. 6 types of mixed state were identified. Classification of mood disorders: mood disorders, split into bipolar and depressive disorders #publiclecture Most common symptom of bipolar disorder is depression #publiclecture 1/3 of bipolar disorder patients are usually misdiagnosed with depressive disorder! #publiclecture Natural history of bipolar disorder: considerable suicide risk. Very variable illness though. #publiclecture What does bipolar disorder cost in the UK? Approx £2 billion in direct and indirect costs but could be closer to £5.2 billion #publiclecture Anti-depressants could actually make bipolar disorder worse #publiclecture 60% money spent goes towards 'fighting fires.' If patients go into specialist clinics savings could be made. #publiclecture Prof Allan Young now wrapping up his #publiclecture...

Need to motivate scientists to follow their own curiosity #paulnuse Advice to research student #235: “Focus on high quality production” #paulnurse Scientists can’t make up policy – that’s the job of society.

The barrier discourages flow of ideas" It’s difficult to teach science well. Teachers often have a limited experience of the science they’re teaching. #paulnurse Need to attract good teachers familiar with the subjects & make teaching an attractive career for scientists  #paulnurse Need inspiring teachers to inspire kids in #science #paulnurse @scimelb @engunimelb Promote careers outside research: we need to encourage scientists to export their scientific expertise at a high level #paulnurse #stemcell research is really exciting-we can manipulate cells in a way we couldn’t before. It’s like extremely advanced cooking #paulnurse Experiments can take us in all directions and we can follow a path of curiosity or try to work back to a commercial goal #paulnurse We need to collaborate across the different sciences and find ways we can talk to each other as we’re trained so differently #paulnurse #womeninscience.

Try your hand at this one, on CRVS basics:  #ThrowbackThursday to DHIS2 training in Cambridge with University of Melbourne team members Riley and Roger and colleagues.  Last week, the @unimelb Data for Health team: Alan Lopez, Deirdre McLaughlin and Hang Li met with colleagues from the China CDC and Ningbo CDC for a mid-term #CRVS and mortality statistics evaluation meeting.

#Data4Health  A major challenge to quality cause of death (COD) statistics is that in low- and lower middle-income countries, over two-thirds or more of deaths take place outside of health facilities. See more on sources of COD statistics on the #CRVS Knowledge Gateway:  What is automated verbal autopsy (VA) and how does it differ from medical certification of cause of death?

@dfat_iXc @BloombergDotOrg #Data4Health #MCCOD  Last week, a #GBD report published in @TheLancet estimated that Spain will overtake Japan as the nation with the highest average life expectancy. Hear why with our Director on @RadioLIVENZ:  Notification of deaths, particularly deaths in the community, requires special attention and likely needs specific tailored interventions. Checklists have been developed for countries to audit and improve internal notification of community deaths:  Our new report with @SwissTPH and @INDEPTHNetwork provides practical guidance about how population and health observatories and CRVS systems can collaborate, to ultimately improve the registration and certification of births, deaths, and causes of death:  Recently our friends @Minsa_Peru with @VitalStrategies @INEI_oficialhave released a new report pointing the way to better health and increased equality for Peru.

@BloombergDotOrg @dfat_iXc @VitalStrategies  Thanks @montgomerynz!  NEW resource: This SmartVA IT action guide describes how to install and use the SmartVA Analyze software (‘Tariff’) for automated analysis
of verbal autopsy data:  Curious to see how countries are strengthening their civil registration and vital statistics systems (to shape evidence-based preventative health policy and planning)? You're in luck! Check out our videos:  📷Final evaluation on the implementation of #Iris automated mortality coding in Philippines. Iris codes multiple causes of death and selects the underlying cause of death for statistical tabulation. More on Iris:  The @BloombergDotOrg #Data4Health Initiative "has been fundamental in spurring global action on civil registration and vital statistics, or CRVS data," writes @lisa_cornish in @devex:  What we are all about. Better data to prevent premature deaths. Our #Data4Health Director, Professor Alan Lopez explains:

@unimelb @BloombergDotOrg @dfat_iXc #data4SDGs #counteveryone #leavenoonebehind #globalhealthnow  We have a growing number of step-by-step guides on SmartVA. For a full listing of what is available now, visit:  Did you know that half of all countries are now facing a 'baby bust'? This means their fertility rates are below replacement level. Listen to our Director, Professor Alan Lopez discuss the findings on @abcnews:  More than half of the world's deaths in 2017 were attributed to preventable risk factors. @abcnews breaks down the latest analysis of the Global Burden of Disease study, published in @TheLancet  📷Presentation in Lima, Peru on TeleSerums, an initiative that uses mobile phones to quickly connect rural doctors with specialists for mentoring. 

#Data4Health #leavenoonebehind @Minsa_Peru  This NEW SmartVA IT action guide describes how to install ODK Collect onto a tablet in two ways: directly onto a tablet via the Play Store or internet browser, or from a computer via the internet and copying it across to the tablet for installation:  Physicians who fill out death certificates are often not trained in medical certification of cause of death, but #rizalmedicalcenter in the #Philippines is working to change that. Look at their turnout for post-graduate medical interns!

#MCCOD #CRVS  In a new video, our Data Systems Analyst, Roger Ward, explains how to use #SmartVA on a single device:  Great explainer video with IHME's Dr Abraham Flaxman, breaking down what verbal autopsy is and why it's used, plus how SmartVA's updated software is improving the method. #verbalautopsy @IHME_UW @healthyalgo  New video: Marjorie Villaver from the Philippine Statistics Authority explains her fellowship work at @unimelb to estimate completeness of death registration and assess the quality of cause of death data at the national and subnational levels:  Three doctors in the #Philippines share how they are working to improve the quality of death certification -&gt; to generate better quality data -&gt; to be used for health policies &amp; planning:  What was the civil registration and vital statistics system in the #Philippines like before the Bloomberg Philanthropies #Data4Health Initiative started, and what impact has the initiative had?  For the first time, SmartVA is being used by physicians, to diagnose the underlying cause of death in community settings. Associate Professor Rohina Joshi from @unimelb describes application in the #Philippines:  Historically, determining the underlying cause of death for people who die in community (about 80% in the #Philippines) has been “pretty hard,” says Dr Clemencia Bondol. But now with SmartVA the process has become "simple":  Edith Orcilla and Aurora Reolalas from @PSAgovph share how the #Philippines has been able to drastically improve the speed of reporting cause of death data, which is vital for health policymaking and planning:  Dr Ferchito L Avelino, Officer in Charge at the @officialdohgov Epidemiology Bureau shares his previous experience as a Rural Health Physician and the challenges he experienced certifying deaths:  Raquel Barbosa from the @minsaude in #Brazil's fellowship work examines the country's 33% of deaths that are classified as 'garbage', or unusable, for the purposes of public health planning:  #ICYMI, read our piece in @WHOBulletin on how harnessing opportunities to link #CRVS and health systems will greatly improve the availability of health services, legal identity and crucial vital statistics and population data:  Our latest edition of our e-newsletter, More than Numbers, is out!

Counting births and deaths = better policy decisions = longer, healthier lives. #IWD2019 @dfat_iXc  @unimelb  Women have historically been underrepresented in health statistics, but these are just some of the ♀ working on @BloombergDotOrg #Data4Health who work to change that. Counting births and deaths = better policy decisions = longer, healthier lives. #IWD2019 @dfat_iXc @unimelb  Many deaths aren't 'counted' for public health purposes due to incorrect assignments of cause of death. Dr Chen Lei, Shanghai Shanghai Municipal Center of Disease Control and Prevention explains her analysis of these data:  This week, we're highlighting how #Myanmar is working to improve their estimated 50% death registration completeness and 75% of registered deaths with usable cause of death information as part of the #Data4Health Initiative:  #Myanmar now has real-time cause of death data that forms the evidence base for preventative health policies and plans. Khin Sandar Bo, Country Coordinator, shares how death registration completeness is improving with innovative methods:  Previously Myanmar's health policies and planning were "wrong," said Union Minister of the Ministry of Health and Sports, Dr Myint Htwe. Now, the country is generating reliable evidence about who is dying of what to better inform disease prevention policy:  Теперь мы предлагаем некоторые из наших ресурсов на русском языке!

@JonathanAveryMD  Using #data to make a difference. 

#Data4Health  "Birth and death data are known as vital statistics for a reason. Without accurate tallies for the beginnings and endings of life, it is very difficult to get a full picture of what is happening in between these events." 

#Data4Health  Our newest e-newsletter, More than Numbers, is out! It's full of country stories, video interviews and new CRVS resources. In case you haven’t signed up to our mailing list yet, you can read it here:  In #Peru, over one in five people who die are not being counted. Last year with #Data4Health, Peru launched an electronic death notification system, SINADEF. Read more:  How did #Bangladesh’s timely birth registrations jump from 3 to 40 percent? Find out in our interview with @anirchowdhury from @a2i_bd:  Mortality #data gaps are closing across some low- and middle-income countries, yet some countries "do not know who is dying of what, let alone what format the data is in," said our Director, Prof Alan Lopez, speaking with @amylieberman from @devex:  While abundant data can sometimes feel overwhelming for health ministries, further improving the data doesn't have to come at a very expensive price tag, says @JenAEllis33:  Accurate cause of death (COD) reporting for population health data is important, yet some factors can obstruct physicians' ability to accurately record the underlying COD. Our new resource addresses these challenges:  📷moving to a new and improved deaths declaration form at the Pasbage Korale Divisional Secretariat in Nawalapitiya, #SriLanka. 

@dfat_iXc #Data4Health #CRVS  If your country is considering #Iris to automate mortality coding, there are a number of steps to consider first. Read more about implementing Iris in our updated action guide:  @isiAfrica Thank you Bill for helping us spread the word! Noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide but they can be prevented using simple policy measures. @WHO Global Ambassador for NCDs @MikeBloomberg explains what NCDs are and why we should all care:  📷introduction of Iris (automated mortality coding) at the China @CDCgov in Beijing. This is the first step to develop the Chinese version of Iris, which will address the complex, time-intensive and costly process of mortality coding.

#Data4Health @dfat_iXc @BloombergDotOrg  Why is routine measurement of birth and death registration completeness important and how can it be improved and measured? Our new #CRVS summary explains:  Only two percent of all estimated deaths are registered in the #SolomonIslands. What are the barriers to death notification in the Solomons and how does the country plan to use innovative methods to improve data? Dilip Hensman from @WHO explains:  Our fellow, Dr Tan Ziwen learned how to routinely assess mortality data using the software ANACONDA in #Shanghai during her time with us at @unimelb . What did she learn and how might her lessons impact #CRVS in Shanghai?  Our director Prof Kim Bennell and one of our lovely participants speaking on Nine News this week about our RESTORE study for platelet-rich plasma for knee osteoarthritis.  Director @KimBennell &amp; one of our study participants speak w/ @9NewsAUS about our RESTORE study for platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for knee #osteoarthritis.

This is defined as. . . a disease or condition associated with morbidity that has substantial impact on day-to-day functioning."  .@UofTDoMChair :#diabetes #hypertension &amp; #CVD communities may "see" but "not see" our #osteoarthritis patients.

We need to change this and bring attn to the seriousness of osteoarthritis #OARSI2018 Prof Nigel Arden provides us with additional epi data on comordity w/ #osteoarthritis: there is an increased risk of combordities in patients incl: #CVD #diabetes.  This affects treatment choices and may be associated w/poor outcomes #OARSI2018 In this individual patient data #metaanalysis of mortality in patients w/ #Osteoarthritis it was demonstrated that OA itself may be responsible for 48% increased risk of pre-mature mortality, controlling for comorbidities #OARSI2018  ❗#DYK: #Osteoarthritis has now been accepted as a serious disease by the @US_FDA ❗#OARSI2018 @OARSInews  Dr. Becki Cleveland adds to the literature on mortality for people w/ hip #osteoarthritis and/or hip pain.

You can read the full protocol of the trial available #openaccess:  Conservative care &amp; surgery are *both* effective, though at 12 mos, surgery produced greater improvement than conservative care w/ clinical significance. However surgery was more expensive and there was marginally less improvement in QOL compared to conservative care #OARSI2018 PhD student Meredith Christiansen on the gap between clinical practice guidelines &amp; recs of exercise for people w/ #osteoarthritis. 3 themes for why: 1) OA is a low priority 2) exercise prescription outside of PCP scope 3) Exercise is individual's responsibility #OARSI2018 Prof Foster of @PCSciences notes similarities cross-nationally &amp; asks if ipssible to change model of care for exercise prescription. Prof @DrLeighCallahan of @UNCTARC proposes  we might want to use ideas from Dr. David Asch of @PM_Innovation re: default choice  #OARSI2018 Nina Osteras on implementing int'l #osteoarthritis guidelines w/ outcomes on effectiveness, feasibility &amp; costs of a 12-week PT-led education &amp; exercise program. The protocol for the paper is available #openaccess via @ImplementSci #OARSI2018  Did you miss Daisuke Uritani's poster this afternoon?

Dr Paterson's work w/ podiatrists, physios, clinical &amp; research experts informs the development of treatment recs to improve health outcomes for pop w/ MTPJ #OARSI2018 #CHESMroadshow  Preliminary conclusions about the #implementation strategy of the SAMBA model: Increased desired events, w/ #physicalactivity group reporting higher levels of PA and higher satisfaction w/#osteoarthritis care #OARSI2018  Our research team found similar results to @MMBrunette @dankwhitept @UDelaware @UDCHS Come chat w/ @thorlenee at Poster Session 3 and let's brainstorm next steps for #behaviorchange to promote clinical practice guidelines #implementation #OARSI2018 @OARSInews  We often measure #pain at one point in time, @DrEParry from @ArthritisRUK @PCSciences uses daily diary method to broaden our understanding of variability in pain &amp; flare-ups over the course of the day/week/month for people w/ #osteoarthritis #OARSI2018. Fascinating! For those interested in learning more about platelet-rich plasma for the management of hip and knee #osteoarthritis, you can read a narrative paper by @KimBennell @ProfDavidHunter @drkadepaterson #OARSI2018  In a pilot #RCT @drkadepaterson &amp; colleagues provided proof-of-concept evidence concerning the feasibility &amp; safety of PA-PRP injections necessary to inform a larger clinical trial in people with knee #osteoarthritis.

Host @kecostello @heyOApodcast have done an amazing job this past year hosting diverse set of guests. You could be next! @OARSI_YI @OARSInews  @lorenzo_masci @kaymcrossley Given that both groups showed improvements and surgery was not cost-effective, then a difference of 7 points which just reaches or is just below MCID is probably not clinically relevant @OlgaKubassova Yes, important to consider components/preferences of patients at the start of trial design to improve #implementation. We know that @dpPTPhD has done work on stated preferences for #physicalactivity for ppl w/ #Osteoarthritis which can help inform trials  @yegphysio @OARSInews @NatJCollins .@pip_nicolson has done a lot in this space w/ for her #PhD work. Something to consider are 3 different trajectories of #exercise adherence for ppl w/ #osteoarthritis: rapidly declining; gradually declining; low adherence groups  @yegphysio @OARSInews @NatJCollins Also we saw work from #PhD student Dan Bailey earlier this week on defining outcome of #Exercise adherence that might be of interest @ArthritisRUK @PCSciences a #systematicreview published in @RheumatologyUK  We’re #hiring!

 Fantastic piece talking to the importance of genomic sequencing from Associate Professor Clara Gaff, the Executive Director of @MelbGenomics, who was today awarded the @biomelb 2019 Most Valuable Women in Leadership Award.  #UMCCRSeminar: Welcome Romy Walker and Peter Georgeson of A/Prof Dan Buchanan’s Colorectal Oncogenomics Group (COG)—working to discover the causes of #colorectalcancer, reduce its incidence, and improve patient outcomes. 

#CancerResearch #bowelcancer  #UMCCRSeminar: We need to identify those people at high risk of #colorectalcancer, with #Lynchsyndrome being the most common form of hereditary Colorectal carcinoma—Romy Walker, PhD Candidate #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: Immunohistochemistry can be used to indicate which MMR gene is not performing properly—Romy Walker, PhD Candidate #cancerresearch #lynchsyndrome #colorectalcancer  #UMCCRSeminar: Not everyone with #lynchsyndrome develops #colorectalcancer. There might be another pathway to colorectal cancer development — Romy Walker, PhD Candidate #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: Romy's aim is to characterise the multiple pathways of #Colorectalcancer tumorigenesis, using genomics and transcriptomics, postulated to exist in #Lynchsyndrome. #cancerresearch #bowelcancer  #UMCCRSeminar: Survival in #colorectalcancer is highly dependent on the stage it is detected. Buchanan lab investigates these high risk individuals to improve screening. Peter will evaluate alternative methods—Peter Georgeson, PhD Candidate #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: Next generation sequencing generate hundreds to thousands of mutations, which can help to infer underlying processes—Peter Georgeson, PhD Candidate #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: Peter is working to understand the impact of experimental settings on mutational signatures. Can you discriminate different cutoffs between two different cohorts? —Peter Georgeson, PhD Candidate #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: Can triage for #lynchsyndrome testing be simplified?  —Peter Georgeson, PhD Candidate #cancerresearch #ColorectalCancer  "If people did every screening test, we would have saved 85,000 lives"—Join @unimelb's Professor Mark Jenkins (@markaj64) on @insightSBS tomorrow at 8.30pm, talking to the importance of #bowelcancer screening and targeted prevention →  “Common reasons for not participating include; it’s embarrassing or icky, or I’m scared of finding out I have cancer”—Prof @markaj64 says a 20% boost in #bowelcancer screening participation could save 83,800 lives by 2040. @insightSBS #insightSBS  InsightSBS: Prof Mark Jenkins’s (@markaj64) #ColorectalCancer Epidemiology lab is undertaking a comprehensive approach to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer and improve results for patients. #bowelcancer @UniMelbMDHS
 #insightsbs: How can we increase the effectiveness of #bowelcancer screening and target prevention to those most at risk? What are the best treatments and most accurate prognoses for people who do get #colorectalcancer? Prof @markaj64's lab explores →  #InsightSBS: #bowelcancer patient Emma is a participant in the @unimelb led ANGELS study—offering hope to inform cancer diagnosis and treatment in future through preventing or finding bowel cancer earlier, benefitting family members and the wider community  #insightsbs: It is very rare for people under 50 to get #bowelcancer, however the numbers are increasing. Genetic testing could mean high risk people can begin screening when they are young and low risk can delay screening until older—Prof @markaj64 

 #insightsbs: Despite it being one of the hardest times of her life, since being diagnosed with #bowelcancer Emma has made significant positive changes to the way that she and her family live, including eating more fibre rich foods and exercising more. #colorectalcancer Prof @maartenijzerman’s Cancer Health Services Research unit uses real work data to produce decision models, improving cancer health services by analysing outcomes and costs of comprehensive cancer care. #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: What is the most optimal treatment for patients to start in the first place? The mapping of real world data is helping the group to build simulation models for patient treatment. @maartenijzerman #CancerResearch  #UMCCRSeminar: Welcome Martin Vu (@mhuyvu), Research Fellow in Professor @maartenijzerman Cancer Health Services Research (@ServicesCancer) unit #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: What if we introduce genomic-based diagnostics for rare conditions onto Australian clinical hospitals? What is the potential value to patients and healthcare providers? @mhuyvu #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: Rare complex disorders are disrupting our traditional understanding on how we should measure costs and outcomes. Patient-level clinical decisions are based on patient-level data. @mhuyvu #UMCCRSeminar: Decisions are dynamic and vary between patients - studies often lose the individual stories. Health economists should move towards patient-level pathways. @mhuyvu  #UMCCRSeminar: What is the value of genomic testing, and how do we determine this value? @mhuyvu  #UMCCRSeminar: Value includes reduction of uncertainty, accurate diagnosis, spillover to family, net costs. @mhuyvu  #UMCCRSeminar: #UMCCRSeminar: Welcome Associate Professor @Aung_Ko_Win, NHMRC Career Development Fellow, Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics with Professor Mark Jenkins (@markaj64)  #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: #Lynchsyndrome is caused by the mismatch repair (MMR) gene germline mutation. There are wide variations in #colorectalcancer risk by age, sex, gene and geographic region. Even across carriers of a specific MMR variant, there is a wide variation in risk.  #UMCCRSeminar: The International Mismatch Repair Consortium was founded by Prof @markaj64, establishing a database to coordinate pedigree data of 6,000 #LynchSyndrome families to date, from across the world  #UMCCRSeminar: we need to characterise how important it is to identify and characterise the genetic and environmental modifiers of cancer risk in #lynchsyndrome. Modifiers studied so far include body weight, smoking, alcohol. @Aung_Ko_Win  #UMCCRSeminar: Families were recruited to the Colon Cancer Family Registry in 1998, with 15,000 families and 43,000 individuals - 748 families are mutation carriers.  Why are so many Australians getting #bowelcancer, and what steps can we take to prevent it?

EX-MED cancer -  #UMCCRSeminar: How do we translate science into practice to make meaningful services for people with cancer? @pruecormie #cancerresearch @ACUmedia @exmedcancer  #UMCCRSeminar: The higher quality the exercise, the greater the relative risk reduction of mortality. An emerging body of evidence is showing that some physiological adaptions are modulating the progression of cancer. @pruecormie #cancerresearch @ACUmedia @exmedcancer  #UMCCRSeminar: Cancer treatments cause significant physical deconditioning and declines in patients. A physiological adaption can help to reverse function inpairness and cancer-related fatigue. But the exercise must be right. @pruecormie #cancerresearch @ACUmedia @exmedcancer  #UMCCRSeminar:  We need to prescribe exercise (150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week) as a standard part of clinical care, a position endorsed by @COSAoncology—@pruecormie #cancerresearch @ACUmedia @exmedcancer  #UMCCRSeminar: Thanks to @pruecormie for joining us and sharing her insights on the importance of advocating for exercise as an adjunct therapy for cancer patients. @pruecormie #cancerresearch @ACUmedia @exmedcancer  #PancreaticCancer patients experience significant symptom burden and poor prognosis, but a new resource developed by @unimelb researchers and patients is providing much-needed support after diagnosis. Listen in to @abcmelbourne at 4.15pm w/ @Raf_Epstein.

 LISTEN LIVE: Prof Mei Krishnasamy and pancreatic cancer patient Graham Wells join @Raf_Epstein on @ABCMelbourne talking  Talking with people with similar conditions made a #PancreaticCancer diagnosis easier to deal with for patient Graham Wells. The PanSupport website provides supportive patients insights, along with information on legal and financial advice, and looking ahead to end of life care. The real point of difference of PanSupport is that it reflects back to patients exactly what they asked for – it is the first consumer-informed resource for #PancreaticCancer patients. "PanSupport provides something for everyone, regardless of where they are in their journey with pancreatic cancer"—Graham Wells, pancreatic cancer patient and contributor to the PanSupport website.  "Reach out, and don't feel isolated and alone.

Shakira Milton of @ProfJonEmery's group contributed to this research led by @CancerVic.  Launching today, @WeCanOrgAu provides Victorian's with #cancer access to information and support to help manage the day to day challenges of living with and beyond the disease. Developed by @unimelb #cancernursing researchers with @VicGovDHHS funding. 

 Supportive care is about empathy for the individual patient and their experience, as well as a capable workforce and system—Karen Botting, Manager Cancer Reform at @VicGovDHHS launching @WeCanOrgAu #MonLunchLive

 .@WeCanOrgAu: How do individuals find the information that they want, and how do we create an opportunity for clinicians to help their patients readily navigate the information that they want—@unimelb Chair in Cancer Nursing Prof Mei Krishnasamy #MonLunchLive  People want information to be able to take control of their own lives and have a voice. We should be asking people from the point of diagnosis, is there something that you need help with? This is imperative— Prof Mei Krishnasamy @UniMelbMDHS @WeCanOrgAu #MonLunchLive @VicGovDHHS  We Can provide support to anyone, anywhere, anytime—Prof Mei Krishnasamy @UniMelbMDHS @WeCanOrgAu #MonLunchLive @VicGovDHHS  Consumer representative Heather Beanland says that cancer patients have support available to them to live well through  Two exciting opportunities open in Prof Oliver Hoffman's (@fiamh) team for a Research Engineer and Bioinformatician, Genomic Medicine.

A new Single Cell User Group will be running fortnightly seminars within the VCCC building to discuss all things single cell—including projects, papers, grants and troubleshooting. EOIs are open now→ "Thankfully- basic science research in Australia is dead" Really?! Kicking off the Comprehensive Cancer PhD Grand Debate. We are putting our support behind the NEGATIVE side, led by @CarolynShembrey, PhD student with A/Prof Fred Hollande’s lab at @UMCCR.  And here we have POSITIVE, what is set to be the losing team, just presented with garlic charms by the POSITIVES. Good luck, you'll need it @McArthurGrant @ProfSharonLewin and Dr Ashley Ng. #cancerpdh  #cancerphd: @CarolynShembrey says basic research is NOT dead in Australia. It's looking at the very border of our knowledge and pushing it forward. 

And the @VicCompCancerCr themselves present an award in basic research! Take that, @McArthurGrant  #cancerphd: @McArthurGrant Jr is trying his best to bring it back around.. but is the joke now on us?! Will the @VicCompCancerCr can their basic research award?! 😂  In closing at the #cancerphd debate: Wifi was discovered by a team of basic radial shriners at csiro—without this the time between voting for your winning team and getting a wine in the atrium would be exponentially increased! Congrats @CarolynShembrey and team!  Moderator, Professor Anne Kelso, CEO @nhmrc, says they have deployed over $3.4 billion to basic research—another point adding to the compelling debate for basic research. Time will prove that today's basic research will be useful, that basic research is just *not yet* applied 👏  Thank you to all for such a humorous and entertaining debate, about a very serious topic! It's not often that you see prophylactics thrown on the CEO of the NHMRC's head 😂 Well done, to all involved. Until next year! #cancerphd  #UMCCRSeminar: Our own @ProfJonEmery, Herman Professor of Primary Care Cancer Research @unimelb, joins us this morning, covering his group’s work in studying the role of #primarycare across the cancer continuum –  #UMCCRSeminar: @ProfJonEmery's group are working to increase the risk appropriate participation in bowel cancer screening programs. The electronic CRISP risk assessment tool looks at factors including BMI and diet. And the use of expected frequency trees to communicate risk.  #UMCCRSeminar: @sibel_saya's work explores patient informed choice for genomic testing for #colorectalcancer. This has led to a potential new SCRIPT trial. #primarycare #CancerResearch  #UMCCRSeminar: A model that underpins much of @ProfJonEmery's work—the pathway of development of a bodily charge, our symptom, through to diagnosis of cancer, and the factors that may contribute to delay in diagnosis to treatment. #primarycare #CancerResearch  #UMCCRSeminar: The CHEST trial developed a personalised action plan for populations at high risk of lung cancer—these specialised trials had significant increase in consultation rates for chest symptoms, as opposed to wider, less targeted awareness campaigns with minimal results  #UMCCRSeminar: There is rapid increase in newly diagnosed cancer patients and survivors—with increased need for ongoing follow up and filling the gaps in unmet need. Shared care model includes #primarycare providing more wholistic care to patients, with greater support for GPs  #UMCCRSeminar: @ProfJonEmery's group developed an online course in survivorship for #primarycare, which has seen over 1000 enrollments in just over one year since launch. With funding from @VicCompCancerCr @VicGovDHHS  @JonnyNoonan @ImmunologyMelb We sure do! #UMCCRSeminar: Individuals with mutations in the mismatch repair gene are at higher lifetime risk of cancer—the condition Lynch syndrome. A/Prof Pope's talk will describe the group's efforts to develop a new computational classifier of pathogenicity.  #UMCCRSeminar: How can we better understand the indicators that predict for long-term survivorship of 
Glioblastoma—the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumour in adults—so that we can identify these patients earlier in their disease course?  #UMCCRSeminar: Dr Lucy Gately is a Clinical Research Fellow at @StVincentsMelb with Prof Jennifer Philip’s @PalMedResearch group—seeking to effect positive and systemic change in #palliativecare practice →  #UMCCRSeminar: #Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumour in adults. Survival remains poor at 12 months. Approximately 13% of patients survive longer than two years from diagnosis and are deemed long-term survivors—Dr Lucy Gately  #UMCCRSeminar: Dr Gately’s research aims to better understand the indicators that predict for long-term survivorship to identify glioblastoma patients earlier, as well as understand their experiences during survival to better cater for them—Dr Lucy Gately  #UMCCRSeminar: There is a mismatch between what glioblastoma patients feel their reality is to what their reality really is. The shock of diagnosis is a key event, etched into their memory, where they were forced to face their mortality, leading to disconnection—Dr Lucy Gately  #UMCCRSeminar: A/Prof Bernie Pope leads the Cancer and Clinical Genomics research themes at @MelBioInf, collaborating with A/Prof Daniel Buchanan's @UMCCR Colorectal Oncogenomics Group →  #UMCCRSeminar: The mismatch repair gene works in three stages—Recognition of the error, process of removing the error on the correct strand where it had occurred, and a process where the DNA is resynthesised—A/Prof Bernie Pope  #UMCCRSeminar: Only 5% of Aus with Lynch Syndrome (MMR) have been diagnosed—increased risk of developing multiple cancers and at a young age.

 Seminar: Single-cell RNA sequencing tech has undergone rapid development, bringing new challenges—the lack of gold-standard benchmark datasets, making it difficult to systematically evaluate the performance of methods. Join @mritchieau @WEHI_research →  #UMCCRSeminar: New open-source software and datasets made up of single cancer cells or their mixtures serve as a benchmark for testing almost 4,000 combinations of scRNA-seq data analysis methods—A/Prof Matt Ritchie (@mritchieau) joins us from @WEHI_research #singlecell  #UMCCRSeminar: sequencing technologies are calculating an average of gene expression. How can we scale to get enough signal for a single cell? From one cell in 2009 to very large studies today – approx 10m single cell transcriptomes—A/Prof @mritchieau @WEHI_research #singlecell  #UMCCRSeminar: How can we go from raw sequences to tie back to an individual molecule in an individual gene in a cell is there a combination of tools we should use, and how should we analyse these data? —A/Prof @mritchieau @WEHI_research #singlecell #cancerresearch  #UMCCRSeminar: scPipe makes data processing easier. There is now a multitude of tools now available. The benefit of this approach is that it can handle multiple technologies. Comprehensive benchmarking will be undertaken—A/Prof @mritchieau @WEHI_research #singlecell  #UMCCRSeminar: The current lack of gold-standard benchmark datasets makes it difficult for researchers to systematically evaluate the performance of the many methods available.

#Thankyou Aunty for a interesting, informative &amp; heartfelt Welcome to Country  ....and what an amazing panel of women that we will get to listen to today  Moderator Sophia opens the panel asking the audience how important is this year's theme #DontKeepHistoryAMystery

A topic for our morning tea this Thursday @First1000DaysOz @IndigenousUoM @IEHU_UniMelb @BrockhoffTeam  @DisabilityHlth Third panel member Maddi Miller reflects on a air quality project &amp; the importance of Indigenous seasonal knowledge, noting "Let's start from an Indigenous place first &amp; make that your framework. Provides a more meaningful way to approach your research" #NRW2018 #RecWeek #UoMNRW Lack of inclusion of Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander content in primary &amp; secondary school curriculum was highlighted by the audience &amp; now the fourth panel member Kylie Gould. #DontKeepHistoryAMystery Advice? "Don't add #Indigenous and stir" #yasKween Question from the floor: I am a recent arrival in Australia with 2 daughters who aren't learning about Indigenous histoy or culture at school. What would the panel suggest we talk about over dinner this evening? 1. Who are the traditional owners of the land where you live &amp; where your daughters go to school.
2. Learn about the Kulin nation &amp; the land of Melbourne.
3. Take them to @bunjilaka
4. Download the Welcome to Country ap
5. Go on a road trip to Yorta Yorta country @MACHAustralia And amazing answers in the room. Such a practical discussion going on that can go a long way towards reconciliation. @unimelb 6. Learn about the two flags
7. Learn about the diversity within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community
 
#NRW2018 #DontKeepHistoryAMystery #UoMNRW #RecWeek Question from the audience: I am interested but where do I go to find our more information

Aunty Georgina Nicholson: start with @Google, check us out  And look up and check out Bill Nicholson

  Question from the audience: how do we ensure that we are doing things that are culturally appropriate &amp; not from a place of deficit? #bestintentions

@FSingletonThorn "embargo your preregistration on the OSF (Open Science Framework)" #staywoke #staypreregistered What happens when you need to run a new (not pre-registered) analysis to satisfy a reviewer's curiosity?

@FSingletonThorn: Pre-registration isn't puritanical, just say what you have done and why. Attention Research Students Piers says "Replicate to lay the ground work for your advanced studies" #foundations #replication Q: How does this all work with computational modelling? Do we need to document all the tweaks we make to models fit?

A: The most honest thing we can do is to not cherry-pick what phenomena your model aims to predict- nothing impressive about "postdictions" @fidlerfm: Editors believe that publishing replications will hurt a journal's impact factor, possibly breaching contract with publishers Journal editors are constrained by multiple factors (e.g., impact factors, direct replications).

The idea goes: over many years, repeated pairings of "schizophrenia" and negative acts (often in sensationalised media), stigma has been attached to the label itself. Is it time for a new label? and do we go for an "informative" label or a "eponym"? #schizophrenia Evidence is that symptoms and illness factors influence stigma in different ways, over the name itself #whatsinaname #mynameis #arosebyanyothername #roseceremony #oshersyndrome = another option?  @oshergunsberg Action shot of superstar @DrChrisGroot talking about the relationship between labels for mental illness and stigma. #StampingOutStigma #theGroot | #PsychTalks #Unimelb #GrootGetsARose  Finding support in the waiting room: peer support is so important! #teaandbiscuits with @alan_woodward1 Mental illness can be very isolating, sharing stories breaks down the barriers - everyone's story is unique, but you are not alone. #PeerSupport Sharing experiences can give people with mental illness hope! #lightattheendofthetunnel #slideintomydms @oshergunsberg #psychtalks @MischaBee highlighting that it's time to challenge the negative stereotypes promoted by the media - people with a mental illness are much, much more likely to be the victims of violence (than the perpetrators).

Are you ready to meet the people of the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences?  In our new #PsychSnapshots post series, we'll be introducing you to our staff and students, and what they are passionate about.  Stay tuned and look out for the #PsychSnapshots hashtag! Meet @DrSimonJCropper. He recently examined "How we navigate in cyberspace &amp; how aesthetics mediate this. Turns out it does matter what it looks like. The product of a natural collaboration with Fiona &amp; Maggie that turned out just peachy."  Happiness hinges on personality, so initiatives to improve well-being need to be tailor-made  Meet Dr @Scott1Griffiths.  He "leads the Physical Appearance Research Team at @Psychunimelb, where we run research on body image, eating disorders, muscle dysmorphia, anabolic steroids, and appearance-related stigmatisation." #PsychSnapshot  What a fantastic evening of research and music celebrating our @Psychunimelb students at last night's capstone poster night! Congratulations @abi__brooker and Meredith Mckague!  @HinzeHogendoorn explaining how your brain tracks moving things in sports for @ScopeTV11!  Meet A/Prof Piers Howe, our Director of Teaching &amp; Learning.  He was excited to say “In collaboration with Campbell Pryor &amp; A/Prof Amy Perfors, I have just had a paper accepted by Nature Human Behaviour on how even arbitrary norms influence moral decision-making." #PsychSnapshot  Meet Andy Sitoh.  He's one of our @unimelb psychology students.  Andy says, "I love psychology! Lately I've been interested in Cognitive and Jungian Psychology and I wish to get into research one day. Beyond psychology, I enjoy salsa dancing and cat videos." #PsychSnapshot  Meet Dr Margaret Osborne (@PEPsych), who says "Musicians have a high risk of mental health issues. Singers! Help me see if the juice really IS worth the squeeze in this new treatment study for #music #performanceanxiety"  Congratulations, @drbrockbastian!  Special event: The PsychTalks Great Debate - Do we need leaders?  The @Psychunimelb and @Scott1Griffiths are proud to support the @Bfoundation RESET initiative. RESET supports schools and other youth organisations in raising awareness of body image issues, reducing stigma and encouraging help seeking in boys.  Join comedian and alumnus @MrSimonTaylor and our most emphatically opinionated psychology academics, as we tear apart our notions of the necessity of leadership in the #PsychTalks Great Debate 'Do we need leaders?' on 20 Nov.

Register now:  "I’m a mature age student with an established career. I enrolled in Psychology due to curiosity &amp; now I realise it has so much to explore. I'm so glad with my decision &amp; look forward to using my knowledge to help other people." Jennie Ma - graduate diploma student #PsychSnapshot  @PaulBarclay recorded our Stigma #PsychTalks panel discussion for #BigIdeas @RadioNational. Stigma surrounding complex mental illness deters people from seeking help and affects the outcome of treatment. How can we stamp it out?  Psych alumna Suellen Peak is a counsellor who uses positive psych techniques to support people who need a bit of help from science to conceive, and has helped hundreds of would-be parents.
 We are looking forward to the @GR_i_PS student takeover of our Twitter feed tonight for our second #PsychTalks event on 'The secret to satisfaction: is everything we've been told about happiness, wrong? Join us on twitter at AEST 5.30pm. @drbrockbastian @lynnemalcolm @jillastark Sarah Wilson welcoming us back to the second #PsychTalks on "The secret to satisfaction: is everything we've been told about happiness, wrong?". Joining us are @drbrockbastian @pkem001, Prof Mark Wooden, and @jillastark. @lynnemalcolm moderating | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb  1st Mental health, tonight Happiness! Colour me any colour other than blue #beyondblue
#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb apologies @pkern001! @lynnemalcolm asks @drbrockbastian "as a social psychologist, do you believe mental illness is on the rise?" #PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb Draws a "stark" distinction between breakdowns and breakthroughs @jillastark 
#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb @jillastark: Happiness might not necessarily be our default, but smiles start our panel discussion here tonight!

#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb  Prof. Mark Wooden heads a study following roughly 18,000 Australians. In it they ask "How satisfied are you with your life?". Only 7% express disastisfaction. Counterintuitively however, they are seeing an increase in anxiety.
#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb  @thejamalhakim @lynnemalcolm @jillastark So good to see you here tonight, @thejamalhakim. @jillastark: "My book is not a tale of woe"... it is a tale of #woke...
#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb  @jillastark "Its not about happiness. It’s about having a whole and rewarding life which is full of meaning". 
#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb @jillastark Parental expressions of unconditional support e.g. "we just want you to be happy" puts a lot of pressure on people to be happy all the time!

#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb @pkern001 from the Centre for Positive Psychology @EduMelb says "one of the biggest problems in positive psychology is that there is a huge misconception that the field is solely focused on positivity and the pursuit of happiness".
#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb @pkern001: Young people are feeling the implicit pressures from the ingrained pressures of our society  #Highstakes

#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb Social media isn't causing our mental health problems, but it may be contributing to them. The angry shouting nature of twitter wasn't helpful to @jillastark. What do you think? Is twitter a positive or negative influence? 
#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb The "fairytale filer" of social media may exacerbate the pressure to constantly be happy. #PsychTalks @drbrockbastian: The contrast of pain makes things worthwhile and we seek them out. #pain4gain

#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb #BDSM @jillastark Real life is obscured by the fairytale filter, making us jealous of happy people that might not exist

#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb The concept of wellbeing has become intertwined with happiness. But this can be problematic. Unhappy periods in our life can often be essential learning experiences which help us build resilience says @pkern001 
#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb Pain can be our warning sign that things are out of balance, and tells us it's time to draw on our wells of resilience- they are deeper than we know @jillastark "How can we measure our joy if we don't have anything to compare it to?" says @jillastark @drbrockbastian gesticulating emphatically that there are differences in happiness between cultures (higher in Australia) that cannot be accounted for by GDP. #pointconveyed
#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @MHFAus @unimelb  Take-home points! What can we do to improve our satisfaction with life? Our panellists weigh in:

#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @HFAus @unimelb @jillastark We are hardwired to be kind, showing compassion (especially to those we disagree with). Dance, run with abandon. Kintsugi- rebuilding makes us who we are  People who are grieving aren't necessarily ill, and we should be conscious of that @jillastark 

#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @HFAus @unimelb  A question from the audience: are there any hard conversations that you have had in your life that made your life feel more meaningful afterwards? @drbrockbastian We sometimes avoid having these conversations so as not to burden others, but it can be a privilege to have that deeper connection. @pkern001 highlighting that social media also provides us with an opportunity to share our stories, a point made by @oshergunsberg and co at the inaugural  #PsychTalk #stampingoutstigma #mentalhealth @jillastark Focus on the happy in betweens, instead of the happy ever after A quick question to wrap things up: what can we do at a national policy level to improve our satisfaction with life as a population?

#PsychTalks | @Psychunimelb @HFAus @unimelb We still don't really have the infrastructure to support suffering- we learned to ask #RUOK, but what do we do when the answer is no? Thanks to our wonderful panellists: @drbrockbastian, @pkern001, Prof. Mark Wooden &amp; @jillastark &amp; to @lynnemalcolm for skilfully guiding the discussion! Sometimes it's better to look for the happy in-between, not the happy ever after.

 Beginning NOW!!! @elPATTENDEN  @NickorasT @GR_i_PS  #PsychTalks @Bfoundation @lynnemalcolm @Scott1Griffiths @CMorgan265 @krug_isabel  @Scott1Griffiths kicking tonights #PsychTalks off by outlining the changing face of eating disorders: Eating disorders are moving targets and ever evolving, they are not just about the act of eating #Eatingdisorders  Public perceptions &amp; diagnostic criteria may have changed over time, but the impact of eating disorders has always been severe. Everyone needs to eat! As @Scott1Griffiths notes, research &amp; treatment needs to target the full spectrum of disorders &amp; people who experience them.  Mitch has lived experience with #Eatingdisorders. He says the bullying he suffered as a child created a toxic relationship between him and food. #PsychTalks @Scott1Griffiths explains that #bodydysmorphia is about men who are obsessed with building muscle which falls under the diagnosis of #EatingDisorders #PsychTalks @krug_isabel highlighting the #InstagramvReality divide. #Thinspo photos may be on the decline, but there is a growing movement of people using apps like FaceTune to create or indirectly contribute to #fitspo culture, which is linked to negative outcomes.  #PsychTalks Fitspiration: motivational or toxic? We would like to hear your thoughts! | #PsychTalks #WeightStigma is where someone is discriminated about their shape and size which comes with an assumption with their health @Bfoundation. The stereotype of what is healthy is furthering this discrimination. #PsychTalks Treatment for #EatingDisorders is Tricky, Mitch explains. His parents had to trick him into first getting help! It took perseverance to find the right psychologist. #PsychTalks @Scott1Griffiths advocates for more open and caring sharing of people's #EatingDisorders #PsychTalks @mentalwalls @lynnemalcolm @Bfoundation @Scott1Griffiths @krug_isabel @ABCscience In comparison to the general population, mortality rates are almost twice as high for people with eating disorders; this rises to 5.86 times higher for people with anorexia (Arcelus et al., 2011). It's time to put stigma on stage! @Bfoundation does important work out in the community combatting the pressure felt by young people to achieve a particular body shape or otherwise conform to #beautystandards. Up for discussion right now is working with young men and minorities. @krug_isabel Gender roles can make a difference in #EatingDisorders through self-esteem and body satisfaction #PsychTalks. @krug_isabel suggests 4 steps to better #BodyChecking 1. Pay attention to thoughts about body 2. Causes of body image distress 3. Gratitude towards our bodies 4. Self-compassion. #PsychTalks More information on improving boys body image and the @Bfoundation RESET program can be found here -  Mitch advocates the use of Yoga in stopping the war with his body #PsychTalks #DoNotDoBeyonceYoga Importantly, it's not a "one size fits all" approach to treating eating disorders. @krug_isabel stresses that what works for one person, might not work for another. What psychologists offer is the best, evidence-based approach. #PsychTalks What is clear is that early intervention is key! The @Bfoundation hotline - 1800 ED HOPE - is a free and confidential service that provides information and support. Trust your instincts and reach out, you can and will help your friend or loved ones #recovery. #PsychTalks @Scott1Griffiths reminds us that #EatingDisorders affect adults too! And that the @Bfoundation hotline is similarly available. People with eating disorders need support, but not all interactions facilitate recovery. @Scott1Griffiths explains #proana/ other peer networks can perpetuate disordered eating. His advice for parents - don't cut off internet access, encourage healthy relationships #PsychTalks @Scott1Griffiths You can't compel people to conform to a certain body type/shape and then not offer them treatment for the negative outcomes. #EatingDisorders is a moral issue and imperative for society. #PsychTalks Research participants elected the @Bfoundation to be the recipient of their donations #$1000 #PsychTalks  Special thank you to our great panelists @Bfoundation @Scott1Griffiths @CMorgan265 @krug_isabel and our moderator @lynnemalcolm for their discussion on #EatingDisorders #PsychTalks Practicing meditation also appears to have benefits for the brain, with a study showing that an eight-week mindfulness meditation program made measurable changes in brain regions associated with memory, sense of self, empathy and stress. @ntvandam  Professor Charles Abraham spent many years in the UK designing and evaluating behaviour change interventions. Now, he has joined our team and hopes to help improve Australia’s health by continuing his work here.  While this conviction will provide a sense of justice and validation for many, the reactions of survivors and their families are likely to be complex and varied and may include anger, validation, sadness, loss and relief.

#PsychTalks Prof Charles Abraham asks the audience you read this slide and asks what these symptoms relate to? #Psychtalks  We can largely improve population health and reduce health costs by preventing people from getting sick in the first place. So why don't we?

#PsychTalks So why don't we change? 1. We lack the knowledge (including holding mistaken beliefs. 2. We are concerned about what others think about us. 3. We lack motivation. 4. We have too many other priorities (the time isn't right).
#PsychTalks 1/3 5. We lack confidence that we won't be successful in changing. 6. We lack planning skills. 7. We lack performative skills. 8. We live in an environment that facilitates our present patterns of behaviour. 
#PsychTalks 2/3 9. We discover we cannot overcome existing habits. 10. We discover we cannot maintain change or new habits after achieving change.
#PsychTalks 3/3 Unless you know 1. How many calories an adult should eat a day, and 2. How many calories are in a chocolate bar, and 3. How long it takes to walk off those calories - how can you really know how to manage your diet healthily?

#PsychTalks  Thinking about calories in terms of walking times. Would you be more inclined to eat something healthier if you knew a chocolate bar would take 42 minutes of walking to burn off?

#PsychTalks  Health promotion materials focused on people's intention to change, others attitudes to behaviours and self-efficacy (you can do it!) are more successful than materials communicating the severity of disease or your susceptibility to disease.

  #PsychTalks If you can link your behaviour change to your core identity goals (rather then doing it because of what other people think) then you are more likely to maintain your goals. So don't just try to get fit to look good at a wedding - make goals for your life rather than events. These are some pretty clear instructions to help with sleep. But how many of us are motivated to do all of these?

#PsychTalks  Apps that help people lose weight are largely unhelpful if they don't include goal setting, self-monitoring and feedback. App developers need to co-develop their interventions with the users.

#PsychTalks Group-based interventions (for diet and exercise) have varied results, although people do tend to lose up to 5% more weight by participating in group-based interventions. 

#PsychTalks Our behaviour is regulated by two different systems - reflective action and habitual behaviour. How do we change habitual behaviour? By gaining knowledge and awareness, recognising our urges, identifying new rewards, etc.
#PsychTalks For anybody who missed you on last night's PsychTalks May Lecture, you can find the recording here! #PsychTalks
 Recently we sat down with this year’s Elgin Prize winner and Master of Psychology (Clinical Psychology) student Ashley Ruyg, to speak to him about his unique journey.  Hello! @elPATTENDEN, @Josh_Rhee and @vgoodboi from @GR_i_PS taking over the MSPS twitter for tonight's #psychtalks event, "Mind The Hype: Is Meditation Really All That Great?" 😌🧠  Head of School Prof. Sarah Wilson opens by highlighting that mindfulness receives virtually no government medical research funding! 😬💸 #psychtalks #letsgetthisbread  Mindfulness and meditation aren't the same thing, says @ntvandam, we aren't always talking about the same thing, definitions and practices are all over the place! 🤷‍♀️ Definitions of mindfulness vary even in Buddhism, says Hōjun Futen, and wasn't always about physical or mental health! #psychtalks  Jossy Jimenez points out that corporations slot mindfulness sessions during lunchtimes- does this really signal that it's important? 🤔 #psychtalks #mindfulness Shannon Harvey: "Mindfulness is learning to hear myself think" #supersizeme #butfortheenlightened #psychtalks When practising mindfulness, people aren't always ready for the things to come up, including the things you don't want to deal with! 😬 It can go wrong if you don't have support! #psychtalks Hōjun contrasts Eastern and Western approaches here- "prove its true and I'll look at it" vs. "just go do it and wisdom will come from within" #psychtalks 💪 Mindfulness doesn't necessarily make you happier! Shannon coins a new word for #psychtalks in "discomfortable" (adj.) - being comfortable with discomfort. We don't learn how to deal with pain!

Suffering is the mental anguish when in pain, but they aren't the same thing! 🤯 Hōjun adds that Buddhism teaches that pain is inevitable, but suffering is not 🤯🤯🤯 Shannon: Mindfulness is super exciting, and addresses a sore need in society, but we need to be careful not to over-promise or oversell! We need to put out scientific goggles on and get some good research out there 🔎 #psychtalks #wherethemoneyatthough Research effort goes into new interventions before we know if existing ones work- we're reinventing the wheel, without testing out the wheel first! #psychtalks #breakthewheel #danydidnothingwrong #okmaybesomethings  On what makes a good teacher, Jossy says that who they are can be more important that what they are telling you, are they humble? Do they want something out of you? 🤔 #psychtalks #doyourhomework #SusThemOut  Also, watch out for red flags 🚩
@ntvandam advises checking out what they are and aren't telling you about their backgrounds/expertise #psychtalks In a capitalist society, teachers like Jossy have to compete for students, which influences how mindfulness is marketed and talked about. Are we out here to push a product or to be in service of others? #psychtalks 🚨 Spoiler Alert 🚨
Shannon finds that there was a point for her when she didn't scientific evidence to know it worked for her #psychtalks  We're in the midst of a global mental health crisis, Shannon points out at #psychtalks. On the use of mindfulness: 

✔️Affordable
✔️Growing evidence base
✔️Disseminable to large groups

There are a few groups doing evidence-based mindfulness. Super exciting! Hōjun speaks about mindfulness in prisons: it gives people the time and space to hear themselves and others. #prisonofthemind #psychtalks  Mindfulness for refugees- Jossy says it can make the oppressed feel better in their oppression, and it works, but we can't okay with oppression- We can do better! 💪 #psychtalks The #psychtalks takeaway seems to be "throw money at @ntvandam and his research", but he points out it doesn't necessarily take huge amounts of money, we don't need billions to move the field forward 💸🍞💸 

@healthgovau where u at  And we turn it over to the #psychtalks crowd! Our first question: "how do we make mental health a national issue?"

As a journalist, Shannon says to make it personal, tell a story that makes a social impact! 💥  A shoutout from the crowd for Thich Nhat Hanh, who is credited for introduced mindfulness to the West.

Hōjun agrees, but notes many additional perspectives within Buddhism shape our understanding of mindfulness as well!

#neededtogoogle #psychtalks  @ntvandam says the relationship between orthodox treatment and mindfulness can be harmonious, but the latter is still pretty out there in the medical sector.

Feat. shots fired at a certain other institution 🧐, its dangerous to make mindfulness mandatory! *introducing! Whoops! #mindfultyping #itsdifficult How do we integrate mindfulness and psychotherapy? #psychtalks

@ntvandam says #goals are really important. Why are people meditating? Is it for enlightenment or well-being? Very different set of practices!  Shannon adds that its not one thing or another, psychotherapy is useful, but mindfulness adds something unique to the table by training people to listen to and help themselves! Hōjun offers an alternative take from his perspective! The flipside to #goals is that when you are engaging in mindfulness personally, it's more about the journey than the destination 🏃‍♂️➡️🚶 #psychtalks And that's a wrap! Be #mindful of the steps on the way out! @GR_i_PS singing off 😴 #psychtalks  And we are delighted to have you here! Welcome to the team, Khandis.  Trump backers who were afraid to tell their loved ones. According to the research, people were concerned that voicing their political support would create conflicts and arguments with those around them. Co-authored by @katiehgreenaway  @CNN  @MSEI_UniMelb @LisaMBrophy @bmcsherr @ymaker @P_Gooding We'd love to schedule a meeting with these esteemed colleagues asap. 2019 Brotherton Fellow, James Gross, will draw upon recent work in affective science to consider what emotions are, why we are so ambivalent about them, and how we can adeptly regulate our emotions so that we can make the most of them. Join us on 30 July.  Our latest recruitment drive has been very successful!  Looking forward this evening's PsychTalks May Lecture 'The Psychology of Secrecy' presented by @katiehgreenaway. Join the conversation us on twitter by using #PsychTalks  Dr @katiehgreenaway will cover the WHAT, WHY, HOW and WHO of keeping secrets. But what are secrets? A definition of secrecy might focus on our intention. If our intention is for others to not find out information that we have, that is a secret.

#PsychTalks @katiehgreenaway asks the audience to raise their hand if they are keeping a secret, with only 70% raising their hands. 

Looks like we have 30% of liars in this audience.

If you want to try the keeping secrets test, go to  Secrets are generally told to under three people, they tend to be about ourselves, and they are almost universally negative.

#psychtalks  Secrets are quite fatiguing (mentally and physically) and they can have negative social consequences - people can feel isolated. Concealing secrets and the energy that we put into thinking about our secrets is tiring. 

#psychtalks Dr Greenaway refers to a study that examined people that voted for Trump in the 2016 election but kept it a secret. Their motivation for keeping this a secret included:
- being worried about what people think of them
- ruminating about fitting in
- keeping the harmony
#psychtalks  What emotion regulation strategies do you use to keep a secret? Many people use distraction (eg @netflix - how you doin') to interrupt the cycle of thought. Al though this can lead to poor emotion regulation.

#PsychTalks Research shows that we seek out compassionate and/or assertive people when disclosing a secret. We want people to empathise, and we want them to be able to help us.

 #psychtalks Positive secrets can be energising and have a positive impact on individual's well-being.  So maybe try to hold onto it for a little longer?

#PsychTalks  Signing off from the 2019 May Lecture series! Thank you all for coming and learning about behaviour change and secrecy.  We already have a huge lineup planned for 2020, so subscribe to our newsletter to be the first to hear about our events:  Master of Applied Psychology students Jess and Nadia interned with Our Watch - an org that has been established to drive nationwide change in the culture, behaviors and power imbalances that lead to violence against women and their children.

A reminder that we have moved the venue to the auditorium at the Melbourne Brain Centre (30 Royal Parade) @UniMelbMDHS @drbrockbastian introduces Dr Peter Koval, an expert in the field of emotion dynamics. #maylecture #psychtalks Peter '...rather than emotional stability, we should strive for emotional flexibility...'
#psychtalks #maylectures #psychtalks #maylectures  'If we can't avoid emotions altogether, should we try to keep them stable?' Dr Peter Koval.

#psychtalks #maylectures Neuroticism predicts worse mental and physical health than emotional stability, but does that make stability an indicator of health? Perhaps not.

#psychtalks #maylectures Research by Daniel Kahneman (Nobel Prize winner!) looks at human perception of pain. The 'experiencing self' judges pain differently to the 'remembering self'. This applies to emotion as well. #maylectures #psychtalks Emotions serve important functions: they draw our attention to threats or opportunities in our environment, and help us mobilise to respond appropriately. They are at the heart of our social relationships, and help us to make decisions, 
#maylectures #psychtalks We know from dozens of studies that emotional inertia (predictable and rigid emotions), is associated with lower satisfaction with life, lower self esteem, and is possibly an early marker of future clinical depression.

#maylectures #psychtalks Peter Koval and colleagues invited participants into the lab to watch upsetting films (like Schindler's List) and measured how long it took for them to recover from the unpleasant feelings they experienced.

#maylectures #psychtalks People who dwell on negative feelings and rehearse negative thoughts (rumination), or people who bottle up their feelings (suppression) are experiencing some of the underlying causes of emotional inertia. 

#maylectures #psychtalks Studies have shown you can reduce inertia by 'living in the moment'. This can be done by practising wellness, by exercising, and (surprisingly) by using alcohol (this is research we can get behind).

#maylectures #psychtalks #maylectures #psychtalks  A big thank you to Dr Peter Koval for his engaging talk on emotional stability as part of our May Lecture programs. A recording of the talk will be released in the coming weeks, stay tuned!

Thanks to @MStranslate for filming the event and the fab photo.  Just how alluring would that chocolate be if the packaging was slapped with a picture of decaying teeth or a diseased heart? Research by @DLabMelbourne in partnership with @CancerVic shows that warnings could help us select a healthier choice.
